Doctrine of vicarious or virtual exhaustion of remedies does not apply. — The Tax Administration Act provides the exclusive remedies for tax refunds and requires taxpayers to individually seek a refund. Each member of the class of taxpayers challenging the constitutionality of a tax must individually exhaust their administrative remedies and only after individual exhaustion by each class member can the district court have jurisdiction over the class. The doctrine of vicarious or virtual exhaustion of remedies that allows a class action for tax refunds to proceed when only a few members of the proposed class have exhausted their administrative remedies does not apply to proceedings under the Tax Administration Act.

(2) any transfer to a municipality with respect to any local option gross receipts tax imposed by that municipality;

B. Before making a distribution or transfer specified in Subsection A of this section to a municipality or county for the month, amounts comprising the net receipts shall be segregated into two mutually exclusive categories.  One category shall be for amounts relating to the current month, and the other category shall be for amounts relating to prior periods.  The total of each category for a municipality or county shall be reported each month to that municipality or county.  If the total of the amounts relating to prior periods is less than zero and its absolute value exceeds the greater of one hundred dollars ($100) or an amount equal to twenty percent of the average distribution or transfer amount for that municipality or county, then the following procedures shall be carried out: 
(1) all negative amounts relating to any period prior to the three calendar years preceding the year of the current month, net of any positive amounts in that same time period for the same taxpayers to which the negative amounts pertain, shall be excluded from the total relating to prior periods.  Except as provided in Paragraph (2) of this subsection, the net receipts to be distributed or transferred to the municipality or county shall be adjusted to equal the amount for the current month plus the revised total for prior periods; and 
(2) if the revised total for prior periods determined pursuant to Paragraph (1) of this subsection is negative and its absolute value exceeds the greater of one hundred dollars ($100) or an amount equal to twenty percent of the average distribution or transfer amount for that municipality or county, the revised total for prior periods shall be excluded from the distribution or transfers and the net receipts to be distributed or transferred to the municipality or county shall be equal to the amount for the current month. 
C. The department shall recover from a municipality or county the amount excluded by Paragraph (2) of Subsection B of this section.  This amount may be referred to as the "recoverable amount". 
D. Prior to or concurrently with the distribution or transfer to the municipality or county of the adjusted net receipts, the department shall notify the municipality or county whose distribution or transfer has been adjusted pursuant to Paragraph (2) of Subsection B of this section: 
(1) that the department has made such an adjustment, that the department has determined that a specified amount is recoverable from the municipality or county and that the department intends to recover that amount from future distributions or transfers to the municipality or county;  
(2) that the municipality or county has ninety days from the date notice is made to enter into a mutually agreeable repayment agreement with the department; 
(3) that if the municipality or county takes no action within the ninety-day period, the department will recover the amount from the next six distributions or transfers following the expiration of the ninety days; and 
(4) that the municipality or county may inspect, pursuant to Section 7-1-8.9 NMSA 1978, an application for a claim for refund that gave rise to the recoverable amount, exclusive of any amended returns that may be attached to the application. 
E. No earlier than ninety days from the date notice pursuant to Subsection D of this section is given, the department shall begin recovering the recoverable amount from a municipality or county as follows: 
(1) the department may collect the recoverable amount by: 
(a) decreasing distributions or transfers to the municipality or county in accordance with a repayment agreement entered into with the municipality or county; or 
(b) except as provided in Paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection, if the municipality or county fails to act within the ninety days, decreasing the amount of the next six distributions or transfers to the municipality or county following expiration of the ninety-day period in increments as nearly equal as practicable and sufficient to recover the amount; 
(2) if, pursuant to Subsection B of this section, the secretary determines that the recoverable amount is more than fifty percent of the average distribution or transfer of net receipts for that municipality or county, the secretary: 
(a) shall recover only up to fifty percent of the average distribution or transfer of net receipts for that municipality or county; and 
(b) may, in the secretary's discretion, waive recovery of any portion of the recoverable amount, subject to approval by the state board of finance; and 
(3) if, after application of a refund claim, audit adjustment, correction of a mistake by the department or other adjustment of a prior period, but prior to any recovery of the department pursuant to this section, the total net receipts of a municipality or county for the twelve-month period beginning with the current month are reduced or are projected to be reduced to less than fifty percent of the average distribution or transfer of net receipts, the secretary may waive recovery of any portion of the recoverable amount, subject to approval by the state board of finance. 
F. No later than ninety days from the date notice pursuant to Subsection D of this section is given, the department shall provide the municipality or county adequate opportunity to review an application for a claim for refund that gave rise to the recoverable amount, exclusive of any amended returns that may be attached to the application, pursuant to Section 7-1-8.9 NMSA 1978. 
G. On or before September 1 of each year beginning in 2016, the secretary shall report to the state board of finance and the legislative finance committee the total recoverable amount waived pursuant to Subparagraph (b) of Paragraph (2) and Paragraph (3) of Subsection E of this section for each municipality and county in the prior fiscal year. 
H. The secretary is authorized to decrease a distribution or transfer to a municipality or county upon being directed to do so by the secretary of finance and administration pursuant to the State Aid Intercept Act [6-22-1 to 6-22-3 NMSA 1978] or to redirect a distribution or transfer to the New Mexico finance authority pursuant to an ordinance or a resolution passed by the county or municipality and a written agreement of the municipality or county and the New Mexico finance authority.  Upon direction to decrease a distribution or transfer or notice to redirect a distribution or transfer to a municipality or county, the secretary shall decrease or redirect the next designated distribution or transfer, and succeeding distributions or transfers as necessary, by the amount of the state distributions intercept authorized by the secretary of finance and administration pursuant to the State Aid Intercept Act or by the amount of the state distribution intercept authorized pursuant to an ordinance or a resolution passed by the county or municipality and a written agreement with the New Mexico finance authority.  The secretary shall transfer the state distributions intercept amount to the municipal or county treasurer or other person designated by the secretary of finance and administration or to the New Mexico finance authority pursuant to written agreement to pay the debt service to avoid default on qualified local revenue bonds or meet other local revenue bond, loan or other debt obligations of the municipality or county to the New Mexico finance authority.  A decrease to or redirection of a distribution or transfer pursuant to this subsection that arose: 
(1) prior to an adjustment of a distribution or transfer of net receipts creating a recoverable amount owed to the department takes precedence over any collection of any recoverable amount pursuant to Paragraph (2) of Subsection B of this section, which may be made only from the net amount of the distribution or transfer remaining after application of the decrease or redirection pursuant to this subsection; and 
(2) after an adjustment of a distribution or transfer of net receipts creating a recoverable amount owed to the department shall be subordinate to any collection of any recoverable amount pursuant to Paragraph (2) of Subsection B of this section. 
I. Upon the direction of the secretary of finance and administration pursuant to Section 9-6-5.2 NMSA 1978, the secretary shall temporarily withhold the balance of a distribution to a municipality or county, net of any decrease or redirected amount pursuant to Subsection H of this section and any recoverable amount pursuant to Paragraph (2) of Subsection B of this section, that has failed to submit an audit report required by the Audit Act [12-6-1 to 12-6-15 NMSA 1978] or a financial report required by Subsection F of Section 6-6-2 NMSA 1978.  The amount to be withheld, the source of the withheld distribution and the number of months that the distribution is to be withheld shall be as directed by the secretary of finance and administration.  A distribution withheld pursuant to this subsection shall remain in the tax administration suspense fund until distributed to the municipality or county and shall not be distributed to the general fund.  An amount withheld pursuant to this subsection shall be distributed to the municipality or county upon direction of the secretary of finance and administration.

Time limitation to recover over-payment of gross receipts taxes to a municipality. — Where the taxpayer, who paid gross receipts taxes imposed by the state, county and municipality, determined that it had mistakenly paid taxes to the municipality because its place of business was actually in the unincorporated part of the county and not within the municipal boundaries; the taxpayer filed amended returns changing the reporting location from the municipality to the county; in January 2013, the department granted the taxpayer a refund of taxes going back to January 2009; and the department claimed that the municipality had to refund taxes distributed to the municipality based on the taxpayer’s original returns from January 2009 in excess of $2.3 million, 7-1-6.15(C) NMSA 1978 barred the department from recovering any excess state and municipal taxes revenues distributed to the municipality prior to January 1, 2012 and had statutory authority to recover only $120,552 from the municipality for erroneous distributions of taxes made in 2012.

E. If a county has not made the required mileage certification pursuant to Section 67-3-28.3 NMSA 1978 by April 1 of every year of the year for which distribution is being made, the secretary of transportation shall estimate the mileage maintained by those counties for the purpose of making distribution to all counties, and the amount calculated to be distributed each month to those counties not certifying mileage shall be reduced by one-third each month for that fiscal year and that amount not distributed to those counties shall be distributed equally to all counties that have certified mileages.

(3) for expenses of purchasing, maintaining and operating transit operations and facilities, for the operation of a transit authority established by the municipal transit law and for the operation of a vehicle emission inspection program. A municipality may engage in the business of the transportation of passengers and property within the political subdivision by whatever means the municipality may decide and may acquire cars, trucks, motor buses and other equipment necessary for operating the business. A municipality may acquire land, erect buildings and equip the buildings with all the necessary machinery and facilities for the operation, maintenance, modification, repair and storage of the cars, trucks, motor buses and other equipment needed. A municipality may do all things necessary for the acquisition and the conduct of the business of public transportation.

(1) the floor amount; or  
(2) eighty-five percent of the aggregate amount distributable under this section times a fraction, the numerator of which is the municipality's reported taxable gallons of gasoline for the immediately preceding state fiscal year and the denominator of which is the reported total taxable gallons for all municipalities for the same period.  
E. Fifteen percent of the aggregate amount distributable under this section shall be referred to as the "redistribution amount". Beginning in August 1990, and each month thereafter, from the redistribution amount there shall be taken an amount sufficient to increase the computed distribution amount of every floor municipality to the floor amount.

Possession of taxpayer identification number. — The mere possession of a New Mexico registration number by a foreign taxpayer does not mean that the taxpayer is registered with New Mexico for gross receipts tax purposes; the possession of a New Mexico taxpayer identification number did not mean that the taxpayer acknowledged that a nexus existed with respect to its activities in New Mexico for gross receipts tax purposes.

Department lacked authority to impose tax liability against taxpayer who was not engaged in business at the time the tax liability was incurred. — Where in 2009, taxpayer established a business that provided court reporting services, registered with the taxation and revenue department (department), was assigned a Combined Reporting System (CRS) number for tax reporting purposes, and operated the business as a sole proprietorship from 2009 to 2012, at which time taxpayer converted the business to a limited liability company (LLC), and where taxpayer failed to update the business’s registration with the department and continued to operate under the original CRS number assigned to the sole proprietorship, and where the department’s computerized auditing system detected a mismatch between the information taxpayer reported to the IRS and the information taxpayer reported to the department, resulting in the department updating the computerized records to reflect that taxpayer’s business was operating as an LLC, but failing to issue taxpayer a new CRS number, and where, in 2017, the department issued a notice of assessment of taxes and demand for payment for gross receipts tax from taxpayer as the sole proprietor of the business for the 2012 tax year, and where the hearing officer denied taxpayer’s protest finding that 
the sole proprietorship was obligated for the assessment because at the time the tax liability was incurred, the CRS number on file with the department was assigned to taxpayer, as the sole proprietor of the business, rather than as an LLC, the hearing officer erred in denying taxpayer’s protest because to the extent the hearing officer’s decision imposed liability against taxpayer for failing to register with the department, it is not in accordance with this section, which permits only the person engaging in business to be taxed, and the overwhelming evidence demonstrated that the business was operating as an LLC during the taxable period.  Moreover, neither the registration statute, NMSA 1978 § 7-1-12, nor the department’s regulations permit the department to impose liability against a taxpayer based solely on its failure to update its registrations.

Such number or symbol may be changed or revised and information regarding such change or revision shall likewise be given the operator. In the creation of a new production unit or in the event of a change of ownership or revision in a production unit, the operator may request the department to assign a new identification number or symbol, and the department shall notify the operator of the identification number or symbol to be used.

7-1-13. Taxpayer returns; payment of taxes; extension of time. 
A. Taxpayers are liable for tax at the time of and after the transaction or incident giving rise to tax until payment is made.  Taxes are due on and after the date on which their payment is required until payment is made. 
B. Every taxpayer shall, on or before the date on which payment of any tax is due, complete and file a tax return in a form prescribed and according to the regulations issued by the secretary.  Except as provided in Section 7-1-13.1 NMSA 1978 or by regulation, ruling, order or instruction of the secretary, the payment of any tax or the filing of any return may be accomplished by mail.  When the filing of a tax return or payment of a tax is accomplished by mail, the date of the postmark shall be considered the date of submission of the return or payment. 
C. Payment of the total amount of all taxes that are due from the taxpayer shall precede or accompany the return.  Delivery to the department of a check that is not paid upon presentment does not constitute payment. 
D. The secretary or the secretary's delegate may, for good cause, extend in favor of a taxpayer or a class of taxpayers, for no more than a total of twelve months, the date on which payment of any tax is required or on which any return required by provision of the Tax Administration Act shall be filed, but no extension shall prevent the accrual of interest as otherwise provided by law.  When an extension of time for income tax has been granted a taxpayer pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code, the extension shall serve to extend the time for filing New Mexico income tax; provided that a copy of the approved federal extension of time is attached to the taxpayer's New Mexico income tax return.  The secretary by regulation may also provide for the automatic extension for no more than six months of the date upon which payment of any New Mexico income tax or the filing of any New Mexico income tax return is required.  If the secretary or the secretary's delegate believes it necessary to ensure the collection of the tax, the secretary or the secretary's delegate may require, as a condition of granting any extension, that the taxpayer furnish security in accordance with the provisions of Section 7-1-54 NMSA 1978. 
E. Except as provided in Subsection F of this section, no later than one hundred eighty days after the final determination date, a taxpayer shall file a federal adjustments report with the department and pay any state tax due with respect to final net-positive federal adjustments arising from: 
(1) an audit or other action by the internal revenue service; or 
(2) a timely filed amended federal income tax return, including a return or other similar information filed pursuant to Section 6225(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
F. Except for federal adjustments that are required to be reported pursuant to Subsection E of this section, partnerships and partners shall report final net-positive federal adjustments arising from a partnership level audit or an administrative adjustment request and make payments as follows: 
(1) except for where the partnership or tiered partner makes an election pursuant to Subsection G of this section, the partnership or tiered partner shall: 
(a) file:  1) a completed federal adjustments report and notify each of its direct partners of their distributive share of the final federal adjustments, including information necessary for reporting state tax due as required by the department; and 2) an amended withholding return for the reviewed year if such return was filed, or would have been required pursuant to the Withholding Tax Act; 
(b) in the case of an audited partnership, file the returns required by this paragraph no later than ninety days after the final determination date; and 
(c) in the case of a tiered partner of an audited partnership, file the returns required by this paragraph no later than ninety days after the time for the audited partnership's filing and furnishing statements to tiered partnerships and their partners as established pursuant to Section 6226 of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder; and 
(2) a partner of a partnership or a tiered partner subject to tax pursuant to Section 7-2-3 or 7-2A-3 NMSA 1978 on adjustments to which Paragraph (1) of this subsection applies shall file a federal adjustments report reporting the partner's distributive share of the adjustments and shall pay the additional amount of state tax due, plus any penalty and interest due and less any credit for related amounts paid or withheld and remitted on behalf of the partner pursuant to Paragraph (1) of this subsection as follows: 
(a) for taxable direct partners of the audited partnership, no later than one hundred eighty days after the final determination date; or 
(b) for taxable indirect partners of the audited partnership, no later than one hundred eighty days after the time for the audited partnership's filing and furnishing statements to tiered partnerships and their partners as established pursuant to Section 6226 of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder. 
G. The election provided by this subsection applies only to federal adjustments other than the distributive share of federal adjustments that must be included in the unitary business income of any direct or indirect corporate partner; provided that this can be reasonably determined, or federal adjustments resulting from an administrative adjustment request.  A partnership making an election pursuant to this subsection shall: 
(1) file a completed federal adjustments report and notify the department that it is making the election pursuant to this subsection; and 
(2) pay an amount, determined as follows, in lieu of taxes owed by its direct and indirect taxable partners: 
(a) exclude from the total final federal adjustments the distributive share reported to a direct partner that is an exempt partner unless the adjustment represents unrelated business taxable income; 
(b) include only the portion of the total federal adjustment to distributive shares of partners taken into account pursuant to Section 6225(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code; 
(c) apportion and allocate the adjustments as provided by the Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act as applied at the partnership level following any department regulations adopted for this purpose; 
(d) multiply the resulting amount by the highest tax rate provided by Section 7-2A-5 NMSA 1978; and 
(e) add to the amount calculated pursuant to Subparagraph (d) of this paragraph an amount of penalty and interest computed pursuant to the Tax Administration Act. 
H. In any action required or allowed to be taken pursuant to the Tax Administration Act with respect to the reporting of federal adjustments by a partnership, the state partnership representative for the reviewed year shall have the sole authority to act on behalf of the partnership, and the partnership's direct partners and indirect partners shall be bound by those actions.  The state partnership representative is the partnership's federal partnership representative for the reviewed year, unless the partnership designates in writing another person as its state partnership representative; provided that the person meets any qualifications established by the department. 
I. Pursuant to procedures that may be adopted by the department, an audited partnership or tiered partner of that partnership may enter into an agreement with the department to utilize an alternative reporting and payment method, including applicable time requirements or any other provision pursuant to Subsections E through H of this section, if the audited partnership or tiered partner demonstrates that the requested method will reasonably provide for the reporting and payment of taxes, penalties and interest due pursuant to Subsections E through H of this section.  Application for approval of an alternative reporting and payment method must be made by the audited partnership or tiered partner within the time for election as provided in Subsection G of this section, as appropriate. 
J. An election made pursuant to Subsection G or I of this section is irrevocable, unless the department, in its discretion, determines otherwise.  If properly reported and paid by the audited partnership or tiered partner, the amount determined in Paragraph (2) of Subsection G of this section, or similarly under an optional election pursuant to Subsection I of this section, will be treated as paid in lieu of taxes owed by its direct and indirect partners on the same final federal adjustments.  The direct or indirect partners of the partnership that pays this in lieu of amount may not claim any deduction, credit or refund with respect to that amount. 
K. A taxpayer may make estimated payments of state tax expected to result from a pending audit by the internal revenue service prior to the final determination date, following the process prescribed by the department, and such payments will limit the accrual of further statutory interest on that amount. 
L. A taxpayer may claim an amount of state tax resulting from final net-negative federal adjustments as provided in Section 7-1-26 NMSA 1978. 
M. Nothing in Subsections E through L of this section shall prevent the department from assessing direct partners or indirect partners for taxes they owe, using the best information available, in the event that a partnership or tiered partner fails to timely make any report or payment required for any reason.

The 2007 amendment, effective July 1, 2007, provided that if a tax return or payment is mailed, the date of the postmark is the date of submission of the return or payment and increases the period of an automatic extension authorized by the secretary to not more than six months.  
The 1994 amendment, effective July 1, 1994, substituted "ninety" for "thirty" in the first sentence in Subsection C.  
The 1993 amendment, effective July 1, 1993, rewrote the first sentence of Subsection C which read "If any adjustment is made in the basis for computation of any federal tax, the taxpayer affected shall, within thirty days, file an amended return with the department" and made a minor stylistic change in Subsection D.  
The 1989 amendment, effective June 16, 1989, made a minor stylistic change in Subsection A and, in Subsection E, substituted "shall be filed" for "must be filed" and, at the end of the second sentence, inserted the language beginning "except that".  
State returns used for audit although federal taxes filed on different basis. — Since the taxpayer filed consolidated federal income tax returns for a three-year period, 
but, for the same period, elected to file its state income tax returns as a separate corporate entity, excluding its subsidiaries, and since it was not obligated to file its state returns on the same basis as its federal return, the revenue department was not required to audit and assess the taxpayer's income taxes on the basis of consolidated income reported by the taxpayer in its federal returns rather than on the basis of its state returns which it had filed.

Torridge Corp. v. Commissioner of Revenue, 1972-NMCA-171, 84 N.M. 610, 506 P.2d 354, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 592, 506 P.2d 336 (1973).  
Exemption strictly construed in favor of taxing authority. — There is a presumption that an assessment of gross receipts taxes is correct, and in order for the taxpayer to be successful, he must clearly overcome this presumption. Moreover, where an exemption is claimed, the exemption is strictly construed in favor of the taxing authority. Stohr v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1976-NMCA-118, 90 N.M. 43, 559 P.2d 420, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 254, 561 P.2d 1347 (1977).  
Presumption applicable to penalty statute. — Presumption of correctness of this section also applies to penalty section (7-1-69 NMSA 1978). Tiffany Constr. Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1976-NMCA-127, 90 N.M. 16, 558 P.2d 1155, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 255, 561 P.2d 1348 (1977).  
Burden on protesting taxpayers to overcome presumption. — The burden is on taxpayers protesting assessment to overcome presumption that the bureau's (now department's) assessment is correct. Archuleta v. O'Cheskey, 1972-NMCA-165, 84 N.M. 428, 504 P.2d 638; Tipperary Corp. v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1979-NMCA-031, 93 N.M. 22, 595 P.2d 1212, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 675, 593 P.2d 1078; Anaconda Co. v. Prop. Tax Dep't, 1979-NMCA-158, 94 N.M. 202, 608 P.2d 514, cert. denied, 94 N.M. 628, 614 P.2d 545 (1980); Hawthorne v. Director of Revenue Div. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1980-NMCA-071, 94 N.M. 480, 612 P.2d 710, Carlsberg Mgmt. Co. v. State Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1993-NMCA-121, 116 N.M. 247, 861 P.2d 288; MPC Ltd. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2003-NMCA-021, 133 N.M. 217, 62 P.3d 308.  
Presumption overcome when not supported by substantial evidence. — The assessment is presumed to be correct; the taxpayer may overcome the presumption of correctness of the assessment by presenting evidence and showing that the decision of the bureau (now department) is not supported by substantial evidence. Floyd & Berry Davis Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-143, 88 N.M. 576, 544 P.2d 291.  
Protesting taxpayer must dispute factual correctness to overcome presumption. — Since any assessment of taxes is presumed to be correct, the duty rested on the taxpayer to present evidence tending to dispute the factual correctness of the assessments and to overcome this presumption. Champion Int'l Corp. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-106, 88 N.M. 411, 540 P.2d 1300, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 548 P.2d 70.  
Presumption may be overcome by disputing factual correctness. — The presumption of Subsection C need be overcome only by a taxpayer's disputing the factual correctness of an assessment. When the taxpayer challenged the interpretation of a county ordinance in its submitted memorandum of positions, the burden was properly shifted by the memorandum to the bureau (now department) to at least acknowledge the existence of the ordinance. Co-Con, Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1974-NMCA-134, 87 N.M. 118, 529 P.2d 1239, cert. denied, 87 N.M. 111, 529 P.2d 1232.  
Necessity of presenting evidence to rebut the presumption of correctness. — When the corporation contracted with an out-of-state buyer for the corporation to destroy munitions, it was entitled to the gross receipts deduction, and the hearing officer could not properly determine that use or delivery took place within the state without some affirmative evidence in the record to support that conclusion. TPL, Inc. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2003-NMSC-007, 133 N.M. 447, 64 P.3d 474.  
No basis for overturning decision where taxpayer unprepared. — Since the record showed that hearing officer carefully advised taxpayer as to the statutory procedures and his rights in connection with hearing and it also showed the taxpayer did not come prepared for the hearing, taxpayer's claims that bureau (now department) should have given him opportunity to present his evidence at a later time and, although it was his burden to proceed, that he was denied the right to cross-examine a witness who was never called were based on taxpayer's lack of preparation and do not provide a basis for overturning the commissioner's (now secretary's) decision. McConnell v. State ex rel. Bureau of Revenue, 1971-NMCA-181, 83 N.M. 386, 492 P.2d 1003.  
Presumption not overcome by contradictory evidence. — Evidence that the construction contract between the taxpayer, a contracting business and a corporation created a ceiling price was not compelling in view of the contradictory evidence as to the actual cost of the construction, and the presumption of correctness of the assessment of gross receipts tax was not overcome. Floyd & Berry Davis Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-143, 88 N.M. 576, 544 P.2d 291.  
Presumption not overcome since acceptable audit method used. — Since the "test months" method was used for audit of taxpayers whose records were destroyed by fire in order to determine gross receipts subject to tax, and since there was evidence that the "test months" method was acceptable practice, the presumption of correctness of the assessments was not overcome. Torridge Corp. v. Comm'r of Revenue, 1972-NMCA-171, 84 N.M. 610, 506 P.2d 354, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 592, 506 P.2d 336 (1973).  
Evidence of entitlement to a manufacturing deduction. — A biotechnology company whose expertise was in the diagnosis of genetic disorders that could be detected through the appearance of chromosomes, and who produced tangible objects that were provided to its customers, such as a written report of its experts' diagnosis and a laminated karyotype, which consisted of photographs of chromosomes that were numbered and pasted onto a piece of laminated cardboard, did not establish its 
entitlement to a manufacturing deduction, since the company could not identify any out-of-state purchases that would be subject to the compensating tax of products incorporated into its reports or laminated karyotypes. The department, whose assessment is assumed correct, had identified as subject to the compensating tax such items as microscopes, sinks, and furniture, which undoubtedly were not incorporated into the documents or laminated karyotypes. Vivigen, Inc. v. Minzner, 1994-NMCA-027, 117 N.M. 224, 870 P.2d 1382.  
Presumption overcome when no basis for assessments existed. — Since the undisputed evidence of no audit for a two-year period of no test for gross receipts for those years and of different under-reporting percentages for the audited period established an absence of any basis for the assessments for that period, such showing overcame the presumption that the assessments were correct. Torridge Corp. v. Commissioner of Revenue, 1972-NMCA-171, 84 N.M. 610, 506 P.2d 354, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 592, 506 P.2d 336 (1973).  
Standard of review on appeal. — Department's gross receipts tax assessment can only be reversed by the court of appeals if arbitrary, capricious, or there is an abuse of discretion, such that the assessment's not supported by substantial evidence or it is otherwise not in accordance with law. ITT Educ. Serv. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1998-NMCA-078, 125 N.M. 244, 959 P.2d 969.  
Standard of review on appeal. — Any assessment of taxes by the taxation and revenue department is presumed to be correct and in protesting the assessment of taxes the taxpayer has the burden of proving the deductions were proper. In reviewing, courts will reverse the department's decision only if it is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, otherwise not in accordance with law, or not supported by substantial evidence. Arco Materials, Inc. v. State Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1994-NMCA-062, 118 N.M. 12, 878 P.2d 330, rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Blaze Constr. Co. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1994-NMSC-110, 118 N.M. 647, 884 P.2d 803, cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1016, 115 S. Ct. 1359, 131 L. Ed. 2d 216 (1995).  
Presumption overcome by showing that division (now department) failed to follow statutory provisions. — An assessment made by the bureau (now department) is presumptively correct. This presumption may be overcome by showing that the bureau (now department) failed to follow the statutory provisions contained in the Tax Administration Act. Regents of N.M. Coll. of Agric. & Mechanic Arts v. Academy of Aviation, Inc., 1971-NMSC-087, 83 N.M. 86, 488 P.2d 343.

7-1-17.1. Tax liability; spouse or former spouse. 
A. If the secretary or the secretary's delegate determines that, taking into account the facts and circumstances in Subsections F and G of this section, it is inequitable to hold a spouse liable for payment of all or part of any unpaid tax, assessment or other deficiency for a tax, the secretary may decline to bring an action or proceeding to collect such taxes from the spouse, including collection from the spouse's interest in community property. 
B. The secretary or the secretary's delegate may grant innocent spouse relief to a spouse who files a joint tax return and all or part of the spouse's portion of any overpayment was, or is expected to be, applied to the tax liability for which the spouse is not liable because the liability is determined to be separate debt, as defined in Subsection A of Section 40-3-9 NMSA 1978. 
C. If on review it is determined that the information relied on to make the innocent spouse relief determination was incorrect or fraudulent, the department may rescind the innocent spouse relief and proceed to collect the affected taxes from the spouse. 
D. Innocent spouse relief does not authorize the abatement of taxes or enforcement of any provisions of the Tax Administration Act against the taxpayer. 
E. A lien or levy imposed on a spouse or property of a spouse who qualifies for innocent spouse relief may be released as to taxes deemed inequitable to collect pursuant to this section. 
F. If the federal internal revenue service granted the spouse relief pursuant to 26 U.S.C. Section 6015, the spouse may request similar relief from the department on a form prescribed by the department, regardless of whether the spouse is a joint or separate filer for New Mexico income tax.  The spouse shall provide a copy of the federal internal revenue service's determination with the request that the secretary or the secretary's delegate cease collection activity against the spouse to the extent relief was allowed by the federal internal revenue service.  The department shall grant innocent spouse relief for the same tax periods and tax programs granted relief by the federal internal revenue service; provided that the request for relief is submitted on the form prescribed by the department.  The secretary or the secretary's delegate may decline to pursue collection activity against a spouse while an application for relief is pending before the federal internal revenue service, but the failure to seek or obtain relief shall not preclude the secretary or secretary's delegate from declining to collect tax from a spouse when collection would be inequitable.  An item giving rise to a deficiency on a joint return shall be allocated to an individual filing the return in the same 
manner as it would have been allocated if the individual had filed separate returns for the taxable year. 
G. The secretary or the secretary's delegate shall consider at least the following facts and circumstances when determining whether to grant innocent spouse relief if the federal internal revenue service has not granted the spouse personal income tax relief pursuant to 26 U.S.C. Section 6015: 
(1) whether the spouse had knowledge of the tax liability at the time the liability arose; 
(2) whether the spouse had a meaningful opportunity to contest the assessment of tax at the time the assessment was made; 
(3) whether the spouse cooperated with the department in collection and compliance efforts, to the extent the spouse had knowledge of collection and compliance efforts; 
(4) whether the state can protect its interests without pursuing active collection efforts against the spouse, including collection efforts against the taxpayer; 
(5) whether the spouse benefited from the transfer of income, receipts or significant amounts of property from the taxpayer; 
(6) whether the spouse participated in the business and financial decisions of the household during the periods when the tax liability arose; 
(7) whether the spouse participated in operating a business with the taxpayer; 
(8) whether the spouse had responsibility for the finances of a business for which the spouse participated; 
(9)   whether the spouse had responsibility for payment of taxes for a business for which the spouse participated; and 
(10) whether the spouse knew that the taxpayer engaged in business. 
H. No one factor contemplated to Subsection G of this section shall be considered determinative in considering whether tax collection from a spouse would be inequitable.  Each factor may be given different relative weight, depending on the facts and circumstances presented; therefore, the presence of a majority of factors considered tending to support innocent spouse relief in a particular case may not necessarily indicate that the spouse in question qualifies for innocent spouse relief for New Mexico tax purposes. 
I. The secretary shall adopt and promulgate regulations as necessary for making the determinations pursuant to this section. 
J. As used in this section: 
(1) "innocent spouse relief" means the relief from collection of tax liabilities pursuant to this section; 
(2) "spouse" means a current or former spouse of a taxpayer; and 
(3) "taxpayer" means a taxpayer who is or was married to a spouse who is seeking innocent spouse relief pursuant to this section.  
History: Laws 2003, ch. 398, § 15; 2021, ch. 65, § 3.  
ANNOTATIONS 
The 2021 amendment, effective July 1, 2021, clarified provisions related to innocent spouse tax relief, required the taxation and revenue department to grant innocent spouse relief in instances where the IRS has already granted a taxpayer innocent spouse relief for the same tax period, provided factors that the secretary of the taxation and revenue department must consider when determining whether to grant innocent spouse relief if the IRS has not granted the spouse personal income tax relief; in Subsection A, after "secretary", added "or the secretary's delegate", after "facts and circumstances", added "in Subsections F and G of this section", after the first occurrence of "spouse", deleted "or former spouse of a taxpayer", after "deficiency for a tax", deleted "administered under the Tax Administration Act", after "proceeding to collet such taxes", deleted "against the spouse or former spouse of the taxpayer"; deleted former subsection designation "B." and the language "Nothing in Subsection A of this section shall be construed to" and added "from the spouse, including collection from the spouse's interest in community property"; added new Subsections B through H and redesignated former Subsection C as Subsection I; and added Subsection J.  
7-1-18. Limitation on assessment by department. 
A. Except as otherwise provided in this section, no assessment of tax may be made by the department after three years from the end of the calendar year in which payment of the tax was due, and no proceeding in court for the collection of such tax without the prior assessment thereof shall be begun after the expiration of such period. 
B. In case of a false or fraudulent return made by a taxpayer with intent to evade tax, the amount thereof may be assessed at any time within ten years from the end of the calendar year in which the tax was due, and no proceeding in court for the collection of such tax without the prior assessment thereof shall be begun after the expiration of such period. 
C. In case of the failure by a taxpayer to complete and file any required return, the tax relating to the period for which the return was required may be assessed at any time within seven years from the end of the calendar year in which the tax was due, and no proceeding in court for the collection of such tax without the prior assessment thereof shall be begun after the expiration of such period. 
D. If a taxpayer in a return understates by more than twenty-five percent the amount of liability for any tax for the period to which the return relates, appropriate assessments may be made by the department at any time within six years from the end of the calendar year in which payment of the tax was due. 
E. If any adjustment in the basis for computation of any federal tax is made as a result of an audit by the internal revenue service or the filing of an amended federal return or administrative adjustment request changing a prior election or making any other change for which federal approval is required by the Internal Revenue Code that results in liability for any tax, the amount thereof may be assessed at any time, but not after three years from the end of the calendar year in which filing of a federal adjustments report is required by Subsections E through J of Section 7-1-13 NMSA 1978. 
F. If the taxpayer has signed a waiver of the limitations on assessment imposed by this section, an assessment of tax may be made or a proceeding in court begun without regard to the time at which payment of the tax was due. 
G. As used in this section: 
(1) "administrative adjustment request" means "administrative adjustment request" as used in Section 7-1-13 NMSA 1978; and 
(2) "federal adjustments report" means "federal adjustments report" as used in Section 7-1-13 NMSA 1978.  
History: 1953 Comp., § 72-13-33, enacted by Laws 1965, ch. 248, § 21; 1970, ch. 18, § 1; 1979, ch. 144, § 17; 1983, ch. 211, § 26; 1993, ch. 5, § 7; 1994, ch. 51, § 4; 2013, ch. 27, § 3; 2021, ch. 83, § 2.  
ANNOTATIONS 
The 2021 amendment, effective June 18, 2021, amended sections of the tax administration act to address federal partnership audit or adjustment requests resulting in underpayment or overpayment of state taxes, and defined terms as used in this section; in Subsection E, after "an amended federal return", added "or administrative adjustment request", after "filing of", deleted "an amended return" and added "a federal adjustment report", and after "required by", changed "Subsection C" to "Subsection E through J"; and added Subsection G. 
The 2013 amendment, effective July 1, 2013, permitted an assessment if an Internal Revenue Service audit or change in a return that required Internal Revenue Service approval results in tax liability; in Subsection E, added the language between "computation of any federal tax is made" and "that results in liability for any tax".  
The 1994 amendment, effective July 1, 1994, substituted the language at the end of Subsection E, beginning with "three years", for "one year after the date of the receipt of the amended return or not after the end of the period limited by Subsection A of this section, whichever is later".  
The 1993 amendment, effective July 1, 1993, substituted "department" for "director" in the catchline and in Subsection D and for "director or his delegate" in Subsection A, and made a minor stylistic change in Subsection E.  
Extension of limitations period. — The taxation and revenue department is required to extend the general three-year limitation on assessments to six years when making an assessment if a taxpayer underreported taxes in excess of 25 percent, and the principles of estoppel do not affect the department's application of the longer period. Taxation & Revenue Dep't v. Bien Mur Indian Mkt. Ctr., Inc., 1989-NMSC-015, 108 N.M. 228, 770 P.2d 873.  
Seven-year statute of limitation applied where taxpayers failed to file returns. — Where taxpayers appealed a 2018 assessment of taxes for tax years 2008 through 2011, arising from the operation of an automotive technician business, and where defendant argued that the administrative hearing officer incorrectly applied a ten-year, rather than a seven-year statute of limitations to their failure to file gross receipts tax returns for 2008, 2009, and 2010, the hearing officer erred in finding that taxpayers filed fraudulent returns and applying the ten-year statute of limitation to the assessments, because although taxpayers filed federal and pass-through entities (PTE) returns for the years 2008, 2009, and 2010, the evidence did not demonstrate that the filed federal and PTE returns were false or fraudulent, and the hearing officer explicitly found that taxpayers did not file state gross receipts tax returns for the years 2008, 2009, and 2010. The seven-year limitation period found in § 7-1-18(C) NMSA 1978, relating to the failure to file a return, applied to the facts of this case and barred the taxation and revenue department from assessing taxpayers personally for the years 2008, 2009, and 2010. Vigil v. N.M. Tax'n and Revenue Dep't, 2022-NMCA-032.  
Assessment of severance taxes was not barred. — Where taxpayer was party to a settlement agreement that was approved by a federal district court in a class action involving the underpayment of royalties on the production of carbon dioxide gas; the settlement agreement constituted an order that increased the value of the carbon dioxide gas previously reported by taxpayer and constituted a taxable event under Section 7-29-4.3 NMSA 1978; taxpayer did not prepare or file any tax returns that reported any of the settlement proceeds paid by taxpayer to royalty interest owners as additional amounts subject to severance tax liability; the settlement agreement was approved in 1998; and a severance tax assessment was issued in 2004, the 
assessment was not barred by the statute of limitations. Hess Corp. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2011-NMCA-043, 149 N.M. 527, 252 P.3d 751 cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-003, 150 N.M. 619, 264 P.3d 520.  
Proof of effective date of notice of assessment. — The department failed to make out a prima facie case of entitlement to summary judgment on the issue of the backward reach of an assessment where, on the basis of an erroneous assumption that the date of the written notice of assessment was immaterial because the taxpayer was under an independent duty of self-assessment, it did not offer any evidence establishing the effective date of the notice of assessment.

A. At any time after the assessment of any tax, if the secretary in good faith is in doubt of the liability for the payment thereof, the secretary may, with the written approval of the attorney general, compromise the asserted liability for taxes by entering with the taxpayer into a written agreement that adequately protects the interests of the state.  
B. The agreement provided for in this section is to be known as a "closing agreement". If entered into after any court acquires jurisdiction of the matter, the agreement shall be part of a stipulated order or judgment disposing of the case.  
C. As a condition for entering into a closing agreement, the secretary may require the taxpayer to furnish security for payment of any taxes due according to the terms of the agreement.  
D. A closing agreement is conclusive as to liability or nonliability for payment of assessed taxes relating to the periods referred to in the agreement, and except upon a showing of fraud or malfeasance, or misrepresentation or concealment of a material fact:  
(1) the agreement shall not be modified by any officer, employee or agent of the state; and  
(2) in any suit, action or proceeding, the agreement or any determination, assessment, collection, payment, abatement, refund or credit made in accordance therewith shall not be annulled, modified, set aside or disregarded.

Whenever justified by the circumstances, the secretary or the secretary's delegate may enter into a written agreement with a taxpayer in which the taxpayer admits conclusive liability for the entire amount of taxes due and agrees to make monthly installment payments according to the terms of the agreement, but not for a period longer than seventy-two months. No installment agreement shall prevent the accrual of interest otherwise provided by law.  
B. The agreement provided for in this section is to be known as an "installment agreement". If entered into after a court acquires jurisdiction over the matter, the agreement shall be part of a stipulated order or judgment disposing of the case.  
C. At the time of entering into an installment agreement, the secretary shall require the affected taxpayer or person to furnish security for payment of the taxes admitted to be due according to the terms of the agreement, but if the taxpayer does not provide security, the secretary shall cause a notice of lien to be filed in accordance with the provisions of Section 7-1-38 NMSA 1978, and when so filed it shall constitute a lien 
upon all the property or rights to property of the taxpayer in that county in the same manner as in the case of the lien provided for in Section 7-1-37 NMSA 1978.  
D. An installment agreement is conclusive as to liability for payment of the amount of taxes specified therein but does not preclude the assessment of any additional tax.  
E. After entering into the agreement, except in unusual circumstances as require the secretary in the secretary's discretion to take further action to protect the interests of the state, no further attempts to enforce payment of the tax by levy or injunction shall be made; however, if installment payments are not made on or before the times specified in the agreement, if any other condition contained in the agreement is not met or if the taxpayer does not make payment of all other taxes for which the taxpayer becomes liable as they are due, the secretary may proceed to enforce collection of the tax as if the agreement had not been made or may proceed, as provided in Section 7-1-54 NMSA 1978, against the security furnished.  
F. Records of installment agreements in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000) shall be available for inspection by the public. The department shall keep the records for a minimum of three years from the date of the installment agreement.

7-1-21.1. Special agreements; alternative gross receipts taxpayer. 
A. To allow the payment of gross receipts tax by a person who is not the liable taxpayer, the secretary may approve a request by a person to assume the liability for gross receipts tax or governmental gross receipts tax owed by another provided that the person requesting approval agrees to assume the rights and responsibilities as taxpayer pursuant to the Tax Administration Act for:  
(1) an agreement to collect and pay over taxes for persons in a business relationship, which is an agreement that may be entered into by persons who wish to remit gross receipts tax on behalf of another person with whom the taxpayer has a business relationship;  
(2) an agreement to collect and pay over taxes for a direct sales company:  
(a) which agreement may be entered into by a direct sales company that has distributors of tangible personal property in New Mexico; and  
(b) in which the direct sales company agrees to pay the gross receipts tax liability of the distributor at the same time the company remits its own gross receipts tax; and  
(3) a manufacturer's agreement to pay gross receipts tax or governmental gross receipts tax on behalf of a utility company, which agreement:  
(a) allows a person engaged in manufacturing in New Mexico to pay gross receipts tax or governmental gross receipts tax on behalf of a utility company on receipts from sales of utilities that are: 1) not consumed in the manufacturing process; or 2) not otherwise deductible; and  
(b) is only applicable to transactions between a manufacturer and a utility company that are associated with the gross receipts tax deduction pursuant to Subsection B of Section 7-9-46 NMSA 1978.  
B. To enter into the agreements authorized in this section, a person shall complete a form prescribed by the secretary and provide any additional information or documentation required by department rules or instructions that will assist in the approval of agreements listed in Subsection A of this section.  
C. Once approved, an agreement shall be effective only for the period of time specified in each agreement. Any person entering into an agreement to pay tax on behalf of another person shall fulfill all of the requirements set out in the agreement. Failure to fulfill all of the requirements set out in the agreement may result in the revocation of the agreement by the department. An approved agreement may only be revoked prior to expiration by written notification to all persons who are party to the agreement and shall be applied beginning on the first day of a month that occurs at least one month following the date on which the agreement is revoked.  
D. A person approved by the secretary to pay the gross receipts tax or governmental gross receipts tax pursuant to Subsection A of this section shall be deemed to be the taxpayer with respect to that tax pursuant to the Tax Administration Act with respect to all rights and responsibilities related to that tax, except that:  
(1) the person shall not be entitled to take any credit against the tax for which the person has assumed liability pursuant to this section; and  
(2) the person shall not claim a refund of tax on the basis that the person is not statutorily liable to pay the tax.  
E. The department shall relieve from liability and hold harmless from the payment of a tax assumed by another person pursuant to an agreement approved pursuant to this section a taxpayer that would otherwise be liable for that tax.

7-1-22. Exhaustion of administrative remedies. 
No court of this state has jurisdiction to entertain any proceeding by a taxpayer in which the taxpayer calls into question the taxpayer's liability for any tax or the application to the taxpayer of any provision of the Tax Administration Act, except as a consequence of the appeal by the taxpayer to the court of appeals from the order of a hearing officer, or except as a consequence of a claim for refund as specified in Section 7-1-26 NMSA 1978.  
History: 1953 Comp., § 72-13-36, enacted by Laws 1965, ch. 248, § 24; 1966, ch. 30, § 1; 1979, ch. 144, § 21; 1995, ch. 70, § 2; 2015, ch. 73, § 14.  
ANNOTATIONS 
The 2015 amendment, effective July 1, 2015, provided jurisdiction to the court of appeals to review orders of hearing officers; after "court of appeals from the", deleted "action and order of the secretary, all as specified in Section 7-1-24 NMSA 1978" and added "order of a hearing officer".  
The 1995 amendment, effective July 1, 1995, substituted "secretary" for "director" near the end of the section, and made gender neutral changes throughout the section.  
Exhaustion of remedies required. — Challenges to the validity of the Tax Administration Act must be first presented either through the protest remedy or the refund remedy. Neff v. State Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1993-NMCA-116, 116 N.M. 240, 861 P.2d 281.  
Tax Administration Act requires exhaustion of remedies for each denial of a given credit. — Where plaintiff taxpayers (taxpayers) twice challenged the New Mexico taxation and revenue department's (department) denial of applications for high wage jobs tax credits, once in 2015 and again in 2016, and where taxpayers elected to dispute the denial of the 2015 credits by filing a written protest to be heard by the department's administrative hearing officer (AHO), pursuant to § 7-1-24 NMSA 1978, but elected to protest the denial of the 2016 credits by claiming a refund from the department for the credit denied, pursuant to § 7-1-26 NMSA 1978, and where the department filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that when a taxpayer pursues successive denials of tax credits raising a common issue, the taxpayer must have the issue resolved in the forum where it was initially raised or is otherwise bound by their choice of remedy for the original denial, the district court erred in granting the department's motion for summary judgment, because the Tax Administration Act, §§ 7-1-1 to 7-1-83 NMSA 1978, requires only that a taxpayer denied a given credit exhaust their remedy for that denied credit before seeking relief from the courts. Taxpayers were not required to pursue the same remedy for the denial of the 2016 credits as they pursued for the denial of the 2015 credits; the act requires only that a taxpayer exhaust whatever remedy it has chosen to challenge the denial of a given credit. Weatherford Artificial Lift Systems v. Clarke, 2021-NMCA-065.  
Doctrine of vicarious or virtual exhaustion of remedies does not apply. — The Tax Administration Act provides the exclusive remedies for tax refunds and requires taxpayers to individually seek a refund. Each member of the class of taxpayers challenging the constitutionality of a tax must individually exhaust their administrative remedies and only after individual exhaustion by each class member can the district court have jurisdiction over the class. The doctrine of vicarious or virtual exhaustion of remedies that allows a class action for tax refunds to proceed when only a few members of the proposed class have exhausted their administrative remedies does not apply to proceedings under the Tax Administration Act. U.S. Xpress v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2006-NMSC-017, 139 N.M. 589, 136 P.3d 999, rev'g 2005-NMCA-091, 138 N.M. 55, 116 P.3d 846.  
Federal claims. — Where taxpayers were seeking exemption from taxes under a claimed federal right, the Federal Supremacy Clause did not preclude a state from requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies before its courts will decide state tax matters, unless taxpayers would thereby be denied a plain, adequate and complete remedy. Neff v. State Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1993-NMCA-116, 116 N.M. 240, 861 P.2d 281.

7-1-23. Disputing liabilities; election of remedies. 
A taxpayer may dispute the taxpayer's liability for taxes only by protesting the assessment of taxes as provided in Section 7-1-24 NMSA 1978 without making payment or by claiming a refund as provided in Section 7-1-26 NMSA 1978 after making payment of the taxes the department asserts are owed.  The pursuit of one of the two remedies constitutes an unconditional waiver of the right to pursue the other.  
History: 1953 Comp., § 72-13-37, enacted by Laws 1965, ch. 248, § 25; 1979, ch. 144, § 22; 2013, ch. 27, § 5; 2017, ch. 63, § 24; 2019, ch. 157, § 2.  
ANNOTATIONS 
The 2019 amendment, effective June 14, 2019, clarified certain provisions related to disputing tax liabilities; after "A taxpayer", deleted "must elect to" and added "may", after "taxpayer's liability for", deleted "the payment of", after the next occurrence of "taxes", deleted "either" and added "only", after "without making payment", deleted "of the disputed tax liability", and after "making payment of the", deleted "disputed tax liability" and added "taxes the department asserts are owed".

The 2013 amendment, effective July 1, 2013, at the beginning of the title, added "Disputing liabilities".  
Disputing the denial of an application for a high-wage jobs tax credit. — Where taxpayer submitted an application for a high-wage jobs tax credit, which was denied by the Department of Taxation and Revenue (Department), and where taxpayer did not file a written protest to the department’s denial of its credit application, pursuant to 7-1-24 NMSA 1978, but rather filed an application for refund pursuant to 7-1-26 NMSA 1978, based on its original credit application, which was also denied by the department, and where taxpayer filed a written protest to the denial of its refund application, and where, following multiple hearings before the administrative hearing officer, the department filed a motion for summary judgment, and where the administrative hearing officer granted the department’s motion, concluding that the only available remedy for a denial of an application for a tax credit was to file a protest within ninety days of the denial pursuant to 7-1-24 NMSA 1978, and that taxpayer’s failure to file such a protest rendered the department’s denial indisputable, the administrative hearing officer erred in granting the department’s motion for summary judgment and denying taxpayer’s protest, because neither the applicable statutes nor the department’s own guidance suggest that a 
taxpayer’s sole remedy to dispute the denial of a high-wage jobs tax credit is through the protest procedures provided in 7-1-24 NMSA 1978.  The plain language of both 7-1-24 and 7-1-26 NMSA 1978, indicates that the two statutes exist as alternatives and a taxpayer may dispute a denial of a tax credit under either statute.  Elite Well v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep't, 2023-NMCA-041. 
7-1-24. Disputing liabilities; administrative protest. 
A. A taxpayer may dispute: 
(1) the assessment to the taxpayer of any amount of tax over fifty dollars ($50.00); 
(2) the application to the taxpayer of any provision of the Tax Administration Act except the issuance of a subpoena or summons; or 
(3) the denial of or failure either to allow or to deny a: 
(a) credit or rebate; or 
(b) claim for refund made in accordance with Section 7-1-26 NMSA 1978. 
B. The taxpayer may dispute a matter described in Subsection A of this section by filing with the secretary a written protest that: 
(1) identifies the taxpayer and the tax credit, rebate, property or provision of the Tax Administration Act involved; 
(2) states the grounds on which the protest is based and summarizes evidence supporting each ground asserted; and 
(3) states the affirmative relief requested. 
C. A taxpayer may amend a statement made by the taxpayer in accordance with Paragraphs (2) and (3) of Subsection B of this section at any time prior to ten days before the hearing conducted on the protest in accordance with the Administrative Hearings Office Act [Chapter 7, Article 1B NMSA 1978] or, if a scheduling order has been issued, in accordance with the scheduling order.  The secretary may, in appropriate cases, provide for an informal conference before a hearing of the protest is set by the administrative hearings office or before acting on a claim for refund. 
D. A taxpayer may file a protest, in the case of an assessment of tax by the department, without making payment of the amount assessed; provided that, if only a portion of the assessment is in dispute, any unprotested amounts of tax, interest or penalty shall be paid, or, if applicable, an installment agreement pursuant to Section 7-
1-21 NMSA 1978 shall be entered into for the unprotested amounts, on or before the due date for the protest. 
E. A protest by a taxpayer shall be filed within ninety days after: 
(1) the date of the mailing to the taxpayer by the department of the notice of assessment and demand for payment as provided in Subsection A or D of Section 7-1-17 NMSA 1978; 
(2) the mailing of the other peremptory notice or demand; 
(3) the date of the application to the taxpayer of the applicable provision of the Tax Administration Act; or 
(4) the date of denial of a claim pursuant to Section 7-1-26 NMSA 1978 or the last date upon which the department was required to take action on the claim but failed to take action. 
F. If a taxpayer fails to timely protest an assessment of tax, penalty or interest: 
(1) the undisputed amount of tax assessed and not protested becomes final; 
(2) the taxpayer is deemed to have waived the right to protest the assessment, unless the taxpayer pays the tax and claims a refund of the tax pursuant to Section 7-1-26 NMSA 1978; and 
(3) the secretary may proceed to enforce collection of the tax if the taxpayer is delinquent as defined by Section 7-1-16 NMSA 1978. 
G. The fact that the department did not mail the assessment or other peremptory notice or demand by certified or registered mail or otherwise demand and receive acknowledgment of receipt by the taxpayer shall not be deemed to demonstrate the taxpayer's inability to protest within the required time. 
H. A proceeding other than one to enforce collection of an amount assessed as tax and to protect the interest of the state by injunction, as provided by Sections 7-1-31, 7-1-33, 7-1-34, 7-1-40, 7-1-53, 7-1-56 and 7-1-58 NMSA 1978, is not stayed by timely filing of a protest in accordance with this section. 
I. Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize a criminal proceeding or to authorize an administrative protest of the issuance of a subpoena or summons.

The 1989 amendment, effective June 16, 1989, in Subsection A, inserted "or the denial of, or failure to either allow or deny, a claim for refund made in accordance with Section 7-1-26 NMSA 1978"; in Subsection B, in the next-to-last sentence, substituted "protest" for "appeal" in two places; in Subsection D, deleted "or a request for hearing after denial of a claim for refund" preceding "the department or hearing officer"; in Subsection G, in the last sentence, inserted "permit discovery"; in Subsection H, in the first sentence, deleted "or claim for refund" following "any protest", in the third sentence, deleted "The hearing officer may announce the decision at the conclusion of the hearing or may take the matter under advisement, but he shall, in either case" from the beginning, substituted "The hearing officer" for "The secretary", inserted "of the hearing, shall", deleted "or claimant" preceding "in writing"; and made minor stylistic changes throughout the section.  
Established procedural framework for tax protest proceedings. — Under the Tax Administration Act, a tax assessment is presumed to be correct; a taxpayer can attempt to overcome this presumption of correctness by coming forward with some 
countervailing evidence tending to dispute the factual correctness of the assessment, and if the taxpayer overcomes the presumption, the burden shifts to the department to demonstrate the correctness of the tax assessment.  The burden of proof during an administrative hearing on a tax protest is preponderance of evidence.  Gemini Las Colinas, LLC v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep't, 2023-NMCA-039. 
Overcoming the presumption of correctness. — To overcome the presumption of correctness of a tax assessment, the taxpayer need not prove, by a preponderance of evidence or otherwise, that the tax assessment performed by the department is incorrect; instead, to rebut the presumption, the taxpayer need only come forward with some countervailing evidence that tends to dispute the assessment, but unsubstantiated statements that the assessment is incorrect do not suffice to overcome the presumption.  Determining whether the taxpayer has overcome the presumption of correctness is the first step in resolving a tax protest, and it will only be the last step if the taxpayer fails to overcome the presumption.  Gemini Las Colinas, LLC v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep't, 2023-NMCA-039. 
Department’s burden of showing the correctness of a tax assessment. — If a taxpayer has overcome the presumption of correctness of a tax assessment, the burden that shifts to the department is a burden of production; to overcome this burden the department must put forth evidence to show the correctness of its assessment, that is, evidence sufficient to make the correctness of the department’s assessment a question of fact.  The burden of persuasion remains with the taxpayer throughout the proceedings.  Gemini Las Colinas, LLC v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep't, 2023-NMCA-039. 
Administrative hearing officer erred by applying the statutory presumption of correctness in a manner contrary to law. — Where the Department of Taxation and Revenue (Department) audited taxpayer, the owner and operator of an independent living facility that rents apartment to people fifty-five years and older, and where the department concluded that taxpayer had been overstating certain deductions for its gross receipts tax liability, and where taxpayer protested, claiming that the department incorrectly determined the rental value and, consequently, assessed taxes in an amount greater than taxpayer’s actual liability, and where the administrative hearing officer (AHO) denied taxpayer’s protest, holding that "the taxpayer did not prove by a preponderance of evidence that the method actually employed by the Department resulted in an incorrect assessment," and that "taxpayer did not overcome the presumption of correctness that attached to the assessment," the AHO erred in denying taxpayer’s protest, because the AHO sought a preponderance of evidence to overcome the statutory presumption of correctness, and this evidentiary standard was not in accordance with the law.  A protesting taxpayer overcomes the presumption of correctness by presenting some countervailing evidence tending to dispute the factual correctness of the assessment.  Gemini Las Colinas, LLC v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep't, 2023-NMCA-039. 
Disputing the denial of an application for a high-wage jobs tax credit. — Where taxpayer submitted an application for a high-wage jobs tax credit, which was denied by the Department of Taxation and Revenue (Department), and where taxpayer did not file a written protest to the department’s denial of its credit application, pursuant to 7-1-24 NMSA 1978, but rather filed an application for refund pursuant to 7-1-26 NMSA 1978, based on its original credit application, which was also denied by the department, and where taxpayer filed a written protest to the denial of its refund application, and where, following multiple hearings before the administrative hearing officer, the department filed a motion for summary judgment, and where the administrative hearing officer granted the department’s motion, concluding that the only available remedy for a denial of an application for a tax credit was to file a protest within ninety days of the denial pursuant to 7-1-24 NMSA 1978, and that taxpayer’s failure to file such a protest rendered the department’s denial indisputable, the administrative hearing officer erred in granting the department’s motion for summary judgment and denying taxpayer’s protest, because neither the applicable statutes nor the department’s own guidance suggest that a taxpayer’s sole remedy to dispute the denial of a high-wage jobs tax credit is through the protest procedures provided in 7-1-24 NMSA 1978.  The plain language of both 7-1-24 and 7-1-26 NMSA 1978, indicates that the two statutes exist as alternatives and a taxpayer may dispute a denial of a tax credit under either statute.  Gemini Las Colinas, LLC v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep't, 2023-NMCA-039. 
Claims for refund. — Subsection B of this section does not mention claims for refund. Kilmer v. Goodwin, 2004-NMCA-122, 136 N.M. 440, 99 P.3d 690.  
Defects in proceedings. — The hearing officer’s failure to take an oath or obtain a faithful performance bond; the failure of the hearing officer to submit a written request to the IRS for federal tax information as provided in 26 U.S.C. §6103(d)(1); the reliance by the hearing officer on the IRS Income Tax Examination Changes; and the lack of a valid control number on applicable tax forms as provided in the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S. C. §§ 3501 to 3520, do not affect the taxpayer’s tax liability or absolve the taxpayer of liability. Stockton v. N.M. Taxation and Revenue Dept., 2007-NMCA-071, 141 N.M. 860, 161 P.3d 905.  
Appealable final order. — Hearing officer's order dismissing taxpayer's appeal was not an appealable final order, since it had not been approved or signed by the secretary of taxation and revenue. Harris v. Revenue Div. of Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1987-NMCA-034, 105 N.M. 721, 737 P.2d 80 (decided under prior law).  
Tax Administration Act requires exhaustion of remedies for each denial of a given credit. — Where plaintiff taxpayers (taxpayers) twice challenged the New Mexico taxation and revenue department's (department) denial of applications for high wage jobs tax credits, once in 2015 and again in 2016, and where taxpayers elected to dispute the denial of the 2015 credits by filing a written protest to be heard by the department's administrative hearing officer (AHO), pursuant to § 7-1-24 NMSA 1978, but elected to protest the denial of the 2016 credits by claiming a refund from the department for the credit denied, pursuant to § 7-1-26 NMSA 1978, and where the 
department filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that when a taxpayer pursues successive denials of tax credits raising a common issue, the taxpayer must have the issue resolved in the forum where it was initially raised or is otherwise bound by their choice of remedy for the original denial, the district court erred in granting the department's motion for summary judgment, because the Tax Administration Act, §§ 7-1-1 to 7-1-83 NMSA 1978, requires only that a taxpayer denied a given credit exhaust their remedy for that denied credit before seeking relief from the courts. Taxpayers were not required to pursue the same remedy for the denial of the 2016 credits as they pursued for the denial of the 2015 credits; the Act requires only that a taxpayer exhaust whatever remedy it has chosen to challenge the denial of a given credit. Weatherford Artificial Lift Systems v. Clarke, 2021-NMCA-065. 
District court erred in invoking primary jurisdiction. — Where plaintiff taxpayers (taxpayers) twice challenged the New Mexico taxation and revenue department's (department) denial of applications for high wage jobs tax credits, once in 2015 and again in 2016, and where taxpayers elected to dispute the denial of the 2015 credits by filing a written protest to be heard by the department's administrative hearing officer (AHO), pursuant to § 7-1-24 NMSA 1978, but elected to protest the denial of the 2016 credits by claiming a refund from the department for the credit denied, pursuant to § 7-1-26 NMSA 1978, and where the department filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that when a taxpayer pursues successive denials of tax credits raising a common issue, the taxpayer must have the issue resolved in the forum where it was initially raised or is otherwise bound by their choice of remedy for the original denial, the district court erred in granting the department's motion for summary judgment, invoking the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, because in this case, taxpayers exhausted their administrative remedies as to the 2016 credits, thereby depriving the AHO of jurisdiction, the department failed to explain why resolution of specific, factual issues raised in the 2016 credits require the peculiar expertise of the AHO, and the remedy requested by the department, entry of judgment in its favor, is not one available under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction. Weatherford Artificial Lift Systems v. Clarke, 2021-NMCA-065.  
No abatement of assessment for lack of prompt hearing. — Assessments are not abated merely because taxpayers were not given prompt hearing on protests. In re Ranchers-Tufco Limestone Project Joint Venture, 1983-NMCA-126, 100 N.M. 632, 674 P.2d 522, cert denied, 100 N.M. 506, 672 P.2d 1136.  
Thirty-day requirement for hearing officer decision does not affect "the essential power" of the hearing officer to decide complex and time-consuming tax protests. Kmart Props., Inc. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't., 2006-NMCA-026, 139 N.M. 177, 131 P.3d 27, rev’d on other grounds, Kmart Corp. v. N.M. Taxation and Revenue Dep't, 2006-NMSC-006, 139 N.M. 172, 131 P.3d 22.  
Taxpayer appearing alone does so at own peril. — Taxpayer has a right to appear by himself or by an attorney or an accountant, but if he chose to appear alone, he 
appeared at his own peril. McConnell v. State ex rel. Bureau of Revenue, 1971-NMCA-181, 83 N.M. 386, 492 P.2d 1003.  
Hearing officer need not assume duties of counsel at second hearing. — Since taxpayer's rights were amply protected at the first hearing, and the second hearing was a continuation of the first, at which the only issue was taxpayer's duty to secure additional proof that its sales were nontaxable transactions, taxpayer was granted a full and fair hearing, at which he voluntarily and willingly waived his right to counsel, and the hearing officer was not required to assume the duties of counsel for taxpayer at the second hearing. Al Zuni Traders v. Bureau of Revenue, 1977-NMCA-025, 90 N.M. 258, 561 P.2d 1351.  
Taxpayer must establish timely filing. — Where a taxpayer failed to establish that he filed a protest of an audit by the taxation and revenue department within 30 days of notice, as required by this section, the issue of an improper audit was not before the hearing officer. Lopez v. N.M. Dep't of Taxation & Revenue, 1997-NMCA-115, 124 N.M. 270, 949 P.2d 284, cert. denied, 124 N.M. 311, 950 P.2d 284.  
Decision upheld when arguments based on taxpayer's unpreparedness. — Since the record showed that hearing officer carefully advised taxpayer as to the statutory procedures and his rights in connection with hearing and it also showed the taxpayer did not come prepared for the hearing, taxpayer's claims that revenue bureau (department) should have given him opportunity to present his evidence at a later time and, although it was his burden to proceed, that he was denied the right to cross-examine a witness who was never called were based on taxpayer's lack of preparation and do not provide a basis for overturning the commissioner's (hearing officer's) decision. McConnell v. State ex rel. Bureau of Revenue, 1971-NMCA-181, 83 N.M. 386, 492 P.2d 1003.  
Technical rules of evidence do not apply in hearings before the commissioner (hearing officer) and as the oral evidence provided reasonable substantiation of the documents, they were properly admitted. Garfield Mines Ltd. v. O'Cheskey, 1973-NMCA-128, 85 N.M. 547, 514 P.2d 304.  
Evidential rules governing weight, applicability or materiality not limited. — The rules governing the admissibility of evidence before administrative boards are frequently relaxed to expedite administrative procedure but the rules relating to weight, applicability or materiality of evidence are not thus limited. Eaton v. Bureau of Revenue, 1972-NMCA-114, 84 N.M. 226, 501 P.2d 670, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 219, 501 P.2d 663.  
Director (hearing officer) has no authority to catalogue which evidence considered. — The state has not given to the commissioner (hearing officer) authority to catalogue which evidence shall be considered in determining a taxpayer's employment status. Eaton v. Bureau of Revenue, 1972-NMCA-114, 84 N.M. 226, 501 P.2d 670, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 219, 501 P.2d 663.  
If testimony based on supposition, Subsection H not satisfied. — Since taxpayer's books and records are not adequate to permit an accurate computation of the state tax, and his testimony is based on supposition and guess, he does not satisfy the requirements of Subsection H. Archuleta v. O'Cheskey, 1972-NMCA-165, 84 N.M. 428, 504 P.2d 638.  
Ruling reversed if director (hearing officer) failed to consider all evidence. — Since the commissioner (hearing officer), before arriving at a decision, did not consider all of the evidence presented at the hearing but only that pertaining to the "indicia" under G.R. Regulation 12.5:1 (3.2.105.7 NMAC), the court could not say that he would have reached the same conclusion had all of "the evidence presented and admitted" been considered, as required by Subsection G (Subsection I), and, therefore, held the ruling reversed for arbitrariness. Eaton v. Bureau of Revenue, 1972-NMCA-114, 84 N.M. 226, 501 P.2d 670, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 219, 501 P.2d 663.  
Evidence presented after hearing. — Where the taxpayer's alternative theory for a deduction was raised in the taxpayer's formal protest; the issue was not set forth in the prehearing statement of issues; and the taxpayer failed to tender any evidence on the issue at the hearing, the hearing officer did abuse the officer's discretion by refusing to consider evidence tendered by the taxpayer in a post-hearing brief forty days after the hearing. TPL, Inc. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2000-NMCA-083, 129 N.M. 539, 10 P.3d 863, rev’d on other grounds, 2003-NMSC-007, 133 N.M. 447, 64 P.3d 474.  
Record must indicate reasoning and basis for denial. — Although the commissioner (hearing officer) is not required to make formal findings of fact and conclusions of law, the record presented to the court for review must indicate his reasoning and the basis on which he denied the taxpayer's protest and in the absence of this matter must be remanded to him for further proceedings. Title Servs., Inc. v. Comm'r of Revenue, 1974-NMCA-014, 86 N.M. 128, 520 P.2d 284.

I. GENERAL CONSIDERATION. 
Section grants court of appeals jurisdiction to review director's ( hearing officer's) decisions. — Court of appeals lacks jurisdiction to review decisions of the commissioner (hearing officer) under the Administrative Procedures Act (12-8-1 to 12-8-
25 NMSA 1978), but does have jurisdiction to review such decisions under this section of the Tax Administration Act. Westland Corp. v. Commissioner of Revenue, 1971-NMCA-083, 83 N.M. 29, 487 P.2d 1099, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 22, 487 P.2d 1092.  
Scope of jurisdiction. — The court of appeals has jurisdiction in appeals from a hearing officer's decision and order whether the issues are deemed to arise out of a claim for refund or out of the protest of an assessment. Kaiser Steel Corp. v. Revenue Div., Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1981-NMCA-042, 96 N.M. 117, 628 P.2d 687, cert. denied, 96 N.M. 116, 628 P.2d 686.  
Untimely notice of appeal. — Where taxpayer protested an assessment of tax by the New Mexico taxation and revenue department (department) on gross receipts for commissions earned on the sale of implantable prosthetic devices, and where the hearing officer filed his decision and order in favor of taxpayer, finding that taxpayer's commissions were not subject to the gross receipts tax, and where the hearing officer denied the department's motion for reconsideration, which was filed fifteen days after the hearing officer's decision, and where the department filed its notice of appeal twenty-three days after denial of its motion for reconsideration and thirty-eight days after the filing of the hearing officer's decision and order, the department's appeal was untimely because this section unambiguously requires that appeals be taken within thirty days of the hearing officer's decision and order, and nothing in this section allows for the tolling of the period for filing a notice of appeal.  In re Gelinas, 2020-NMCA-038, cert. denied.  
II. APPEAL. 
A. IN GENERAL. 
Record must indicate reasoning and basis of denial of protest. — Although the commissioner (hearing officer) is not required to make formal findings of fact and conclusions of law, the record presented to the court for review must indicate his reasoning and the basis on which he denied the taxpayer's protest and in the absence of this matter must be remanded for further proceedings. Title Servs., Inc. v. Commissioner of Revenue, 1974-NMCA-014, 86 N.M. 128, 520 P.2d 284.  
Meaning of "claimant" and "taxpayer". — The court of appeals had no jurisdiction over the appeal of an Indian tribe which had been denied the right to intervene in a protest brought by a construction company over assessment of gross receipts tax on receipts under a contract between the tribe and the company, despite the fact that contractual indemnity provisions would ultimately render the tribe liable to the company for any tax due; the tribe was not a "claimant," (term "claimant" no longer in statute) since no taxes had yet been paid, and was not a "taxpayer" since the taxes were assessed not to it but to the company. Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-130, 88 N.M. 525, 543 P.2d 493, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 206, 549 P.2d 284 (1976).  
"Unjust enrichment". — A hearing officer acted in a manner inconsistent with the law in weighing additional equitable factors beyond those required by the doctrine of equitable recoupment, thereby undercutting the required factors, where taxpayer paid correct amount of tax but mistakenly did so as a compensating use, not gross receipts, tax. Teco Invs., Inc. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1998-NMCA-055, 125 N.M. 103, 957 P.2d 532.  
B. ISSUE AT HEARING. 
Waiver of issues. — The taxation and revenue department waived the issue whether the taxpayer failed to properly pursue its remedies under the Tax Administration Act by not raising the issue prior to appeal. Kaiser Steel Corp. v. Revenue Div., Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1981-NMCA-042, 96 N.M. 117, 628 P.2d 687, cert. denied, 96 N.M. 116, 628 P.2d 686.  
Issue not raised at hearing cannot be heard on appeal. — The appeal to a court of appeals from the commissioner's (hearing officer's) decision is on the record made at the hearing. If the record does not show an issue was raised at the hearing, this issue is not before the appellate court for review. Till v. Jones, 1972-NMCA-046, 83 N.M. 743, 497 P.2d 745, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 740, 497 P.2d 742.  
If an issue is not raised at the formal hearing, it is not an issue in the appeal. In re Ranchers-Tufco Limestone Project Joint Venture, 1983-NMCA-126, 100 N.M. 632, 674 P.2d 522, cert. denied, 100 N.M. 505, 672 P2d 1136.  
Appeal to same extent and upon same theory as hearing. — This section provides that the appeal to an appellate court is only to the same extent and upon the same theory as was asserted in the hearing. N.M. Sheriffs & Police Ass'n v. Bureau of Revenue, 1973-NMCA-130, 85 N.M. 565, 514 P.2d 616.  
A party will not be permitted to change his theory of a case on appeal, thus precluding from consideration questions or issues which were not raised at the hearing. Kaiser Steel Corp. v. Revenue Div., 1981-NMCA-042, 96 N.M. 117, 628 P.2d 687, cert. denied, 96 N.M. 116, 628 P.2d 686.  
Audit items not protested or issue in hearing not reviewable. — Since the appellant did not protest items included in audit and these items were not an issue at the hearing, appellant may not challenge, in the court of appeals, the sufficiency of the evidence as to receipts from these items when they were not an issue in the hearing because this section authorizes appeals to this court only to the same extent and upon the same theory as was asserted in the hearing before the commissioner (hearing officer). Archuleta v. O'Cheskey, 1972-NMCA-165, 84 N.M. 428, 504 P.2d 638.  
Arguments not raised at hearing not reviewable. — The taxpayer did not raise the argument before the bureau (hearing officer) that the base figure for the gross receipts 
tax was not correct and therefore it need not be considered on appeal. Floyd & Berry Davis Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-143, 88 N.M. 576, 544 P.2d 291.  
III. RECORD. 
Question of law not binding but inference from facts conclusive. — As all facts before the commissioner (hearing officer) and relating to both questions were stipulated, accordingly, if but one inference can reasonably be drawn from the stipulated facts, a question of law is presented and a finding of the commissioner (hearing officer) to the contrary is not binding on the reviewing court. If, however, more than one inference can reasonably be drawn, then the finding of the commissioner (hearing officer) is conclusive. Rust Tractor Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1970-NMCA-107, 82 N.M. 82, 475 P.2d 779, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 81, 475 P.2d 778; Rock v. Commissioner of Revenue, 1972-NMCA-012, 83 N.M. 478, 493 P.2d 963.  
IV. GROUNDS FOR REVERSAL. 
A. ARBITRARY. 
If Paragraphs (2) and (3) of Subsection D (now Subsection C) are satisfied, then Paragraph (1) satisfied. — Since the order was supported by substantial evidence and was in accordance with applicable law, it was neither arbitrary nor capricious and its entry was not an abuse of discretion. Union Cnty. Feedlot, Inc. v. Vigil, 1968-NMCA-088, 79 N.M. 684, 448 P.2d 485.  
Double taxation is not necessarily arbitrary or capricious. N.M. Sheriffs & Police Ass'n v. Bureau of Revenue, 1973-NMCA-130, 85 N.M. 565, 514 P.2d 616.  
"Income". — The New Mexico taxation and revenue department's determination of the taxpayers' tax liability was not arbitrary and capricious; the taxpayers' arguments that their wages from their employment were not "income" were frivolous and without any legal support. Holt v. N.M. Dep't of Taxation & Revenue, 2002-NMSC-034, 133 N.M. 11, 59 P.3d 491.  
Ruling arbitrary if all evidence not considered. — Since the commissioner (hearing officer), before arriving at a decision, did not consider all of the evidence presented at the hearing but only that pertaining to the "indicia" under G.R. Regulation 12.5:1 (3.2.105.7 NMAC), the court could not say that the commissioner (hearing officer) would have reached the same conclusion had all of "the evidence presented and admitted" been considered as required by Section 7-1-24G NMSA 1978 (now Section 7-1-24(I) NMSA 1978), and therefore held the ruling reversed for arbitrariness. Eaton v. Bureau of Revenue, 1972-NMCA-114, 84 N.M. 226, 501 P.2d 670, cert. denied, 84 N.M. 219, 501 P.2d 663.  
B. SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE. 
Evidence viewed in light most favorable to director's (hearing officer's) decision. — The duty of the court of appeals is to determine whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the order, viewing all evidence in the light most favorable to the commissioner's (hearing officer's) decision. Floyd & Berry Davis Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-143, 88 N.M. 576, 544 P.2d 291.  
Review of evidence. — Whether previous owner sold out its business and whether plaintiff purchased that business is a question of fact and, accordingly, this court examines the facts. In doing so, it views the evidence in the light most favorable to the commissioner's (hearing officer's) decision. Sterling Title Co. v. Commissioner of Revenue, 1973-NMCA-086, 85 N.M. 279, 511 P.2d 765.  
Only favorable evidence considered. — In determining whether there is substantial evidence in the record, the court considers only favorable evidence and views that evidence in a light most favorable to the commissioner's (hearing officer's) decision. Westland Corp. v. Commissioner of Revenue, 1972-NMCA-147, 84 N.M. 327, 503 P.2d 151, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 22, 487 P.2d 1092; C & D Trailer Sales v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1979-NMCA-151, 93 N.M. 697, 604 P.2d 835.  
Director's (hearing officer's) determination conclusive if more than one inference drawn. — If more than one inference can reasonably be drawn from the evidence, then the determination made by the commissioner (hearing officer), that the books and records were inadequate, is conclusive. Waldroop v. O'Cheskey, 1973-NMCA-146, 85 N.M. 736, 516 P.2d 1119.  
Conclusion must be supported by entire record. — In resolving conflicts in the evidence in support of the findings, it is not contemplated, nor is it consistent with reason, that words, phrases, clauses or sentences may be selected out of context and then combined to give support for a conclusion which is not supportable by the entire text of the testimony of the witnesses on the particular subject or subjects from which the selections are taken. McVean & Barlow, Inc. v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-128, 88 N.M. 521, 543 P.2d 489, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 6, 546 P.2d 71.  
Presumption of assessment's correctness overcome when no substantial evidence supports. — The assessment is presumed to be correct; the taxpayer may overcome the presumption of correctness of the assessment by presenting evidence and showing that the decision of the bureau (now department) is not supported by substantial evidence. Floyd & Berry Davis Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-143, 88 N.M. 576, 544 P.2d 291.  
Presumption not overcome when contradictory evidence presented. — Evidence that the construction contract between the taxpayer, a contracting business, and a corporation created a ceiling price was not compelling in view of the contradictory evidence as to the actual cost of the construction, and the presumption of correctness of the assessment of gross receipts tax was not overcome. Floyd & Berry Davis Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-143, 88 N.M. 576, 544 P.2d 291.  
Since there was substantial evidence to support decision that the moneys paid to taxpayer were used solely for taxpayer's own obligations and purposes, and the appellate court found nothing in the record to indicate that any of the sums were used by taxpayer to pay the debts of any of the other three corporations, they were properly taxable under Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax Act (Chapter 7, Article 9 NMSA 1978). Westland Corp. v. Commissioner of Revenue, 1972-NMCA-147, 84 N.M. 327, 503 P.2d 151, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 22, 487 P.2d 1092.  
C. ACCORDANCE WITH LAW. 
Decision not in accordance with law if record not complete. — Under Subsection D(3) (Subsection C(3)), the court will set aside a decision and order of the commissioner (hearing officer) if it is found to be not in accordance with law, and the court's review, pursuant to Subsection A, must be based upon the record. Since there was nowhere in the record any indication that the ordinance in question even existed and the court found it impossible to proceed without some knowledge of the considerations underlying the bureau's (department's) action, the case was remanded so that the record could indicate the bureau's (department's) reasoning and basis for denial of taxpayer's request. Co-Con, Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1974-NMCA-134, 87 N.M. 118, 529 P.2d 1239, cert. denied, 87 N.M. 111, 529 P.2d 1232.

H. If, as a result of an audit by the department or a managed audit covering multiple periods, an overpayment of tax is found in any period under the audit and if the taxpayer files a claim for refund for the overpayments identified in the audit, that overpayment may be credited against an underpayment of the same tax found in another period under audit pursuant to Section 7-1-29 NMSA 1978. 
I. A refund of tax paid under any tax or tax act administered pursuant to Subsection B of Section 7-1-2 NMSA 1978 may be made, at the discretion of the department, in the

Disputing the denial of an application for a high-wage jobs tax credit. — Where taxpayer submitted an application for a high-wage jobs tax credit, which was denied by the Department of Taxation and Revenue (Department), and where taxpayer did not file a written protest to the department’s denial of its credit application, pursuant to 7-1-24 NMSA 1978, but rather filed an application for refund pursuant to 7-1-26 NMSA 1978, based on its original credit application, which was also denied by the department, and where taxpayer filed a written protest to the denial of its refund application, and where, following multiple hearings before the administrative hearing officer, the department filed a motion for summary judgment, and where the administrative hearing officer granted the department’s motion, concluding that the only available remedy for a denial of an application for a tax credit was to file a protest within ninety days of the denial pursuant to 7-1-24 NMSA 1978, and that taxpayer’s failure to file such a protest rendered the department’s denial indisputable, the administrative hearing officer erred in granting the department’s motion for summary judgment and denying taxpayer’s protest, because neither the applicable statutes nor the department’s own guidance suggest that a taxpayer’s sole remedy to dispute the denial of a high-wage jobs tax credit is through the protest procedures provided in 7-1-24 NMSA 1978.  The plain language of both 7-1-24 and 7-1-26 NMSA 1978, indicates that the two statutes exist as alternatives and a taxpayer may dispute a denial of a tax credit under either statute.  Elite Well v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep't, 2023-NMCA-041. 
It was mandatory that taxpayers follow administrative procedures of this section before questioning in court the constitutionality of the tax at issue, and district court correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction because of the failure to timely appeal. Neff v. State ex rel. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1993-NMCA-116, 116 N.M. 240, 861 P.2d 281.  
Tax Administration Act requires exhaustion of remedies for each denial of a given credit. — Where plaintiff taxpayers (taxpayers) twice challenged the New Mexico taxation and revenue department's (department) denial of applications for high wage jobs tax credits, authorized by § 7-9G-1 NMSA 1978, once in 2015 and again in 2016, 
and where taxpayers elected to dispute the denial of the 2015 credits by filing a written protest to be heard by the department's administrative hearing officer (AHO), pursuant to § 7-1-24 NMSA 1978, but elected to protest the denial of the 2016 credits by claiming a refund from the department for the credit denied, pursuant to § 7-1-26 NMSA 1978, and where the department filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that when a taxpayer pursues successive denials of tax credits raising a common issue, the taxpayer must have the issue resolved in the forum where it was initially raised or is otherwise bound by their choice of remedy for the original denial, the district court erred in granting the department's motion for summary judgment, because the Tax Administration Act, §§ 7-1-1 to 7-1-83 NMSA 1978, requires only that a taxpayer denied a given credit exhaust their remedy for that denied credit before seeking relief from the courts. Taxpayers were not required to pursue the same remedy for the denial of the 2016 credits as they pursued for the denial of the 2015 credits; the act requires only that a taxpayer exhaust whatever remedy it has chosen to challenge the denial of a given credit. Weatherford Artificial Lift Systems v. Clarke, 2021-NMCA-065. 
District court erred in invoking primary jurisdiction. — Where plaintiff taxpayers (taxpayers) twice challenged the New Mexico taxation and revenue department's (department) denial of applications for high wage jobs tax credits, authorized by § 7-9G-1 NMSA 1978, once in 2015 and again in 2016, and where taxpayers elected to dispute the denial of the 2015 credits by filing a written protest to be heard by the department's administrative hearing officer (AHO), pursuant to § 7-1-24 NMSA 1978, but elected to protest the denial of the 2016 credits by claiming a refund from the department for the credit denied, pursuant to § 7-1-26 NMSA 1978, and where the department filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that when a taxpayer pursues successive denials of tax credits raising a common issue, the taxpayer must have the issue resolved in the forum where it was initially raised or is otherwise bound by their choice of remedy for the original denial, the district court erred in granting the department's motion for summary judgment, invoking the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, because in this case, taxpayers exhausted their administrative remedies as to the 2016 credits, thereby depriving the AHO of jurisdiction, the department failed to explain why resolution of specific, factual issues raised in the 2016 credits require the peculiar expertise of the AHO, and the remedy requested by the department, entry of judgment in its favor, is not one available under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction. Weatherford Artificial Lift Systems v. Clarke, 2021-NMCA-065.  
Section provides adequate remedy at law. — Taxpayers have standing under this section to contest the constitutionality of New Mexico taxes assessed against them; thus, under the rule of National Private Truck Council v. Oklahoma Tax Commission, 515 U.S. 582, 115 S. Ct. 2351, 132 L. Ed. 2d 509 (1995), a § 1983 action for injunctive or declaratory relief cannot lie with respect to imposition of a state tax, because taxpayers have been provided an adequate remedy at law. Ramah Navajo Sch. Bd., Inc. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1999-NMCA-050, 127 N.M. 101, 977 P.2d 1021, cert. denied, 127 N.M. 389, 981 P.2d 1207.  
Secretary decides actions on refund claims. — Secretary of the taxation and revenue department has discretion to act or refuse to act on refund claims under Sections 7-1-26A and 7-1-29A NMSA 1978. Unisys Corp. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1994-NMCA-059, 117 N.M. 609, 874 P.2d 1273.  
Purpose of time deadline in this section is to avoid stale claims, which protects the department's ability to stabilize and predict, with some degree of certainty, the funds it collects and manages. Kilmer v. Goodwin, 2004-NMCA-122, 136 N.M. 440, 99 P.3d 690.  
Burden of maintaining active claim. — The time deadline in this section places the burden of maintaining an active claim on the taxpayer and department does not have implied authority to allow claim after 210 days. Kilmer v. Goodwin, 2004-NMCA-122, 136 N.M. 440, 99 P.3d 690.  
Strictness of time requirement. — The legislature has stated a definite requirement that it was incumbent upon taxpayers to act within the 210-day window in this section. Kilmer v. Goodwin, 2004-NMCA-122, 136 N.M. 440, 99 P.3d 690.  
Running of statutory period. — The statutory period to pursue a remedy under 7-1-26(B)(1) NMSA 1978 begins from the delivery of a notice of denial of refund when the taxation and revenue department mails rather than hand delivers the notice. Schneider Nat'l, Inc. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2006-NMCA-128, 140 N.M. 561, 144 P.3d 120.  
Letter does not start time running. — Because this section prohibited the department from approving or denying the claim for refund, a letter stating that essential conclusion does not start the time running again. Kilmer v. Goodwin, 2004-NMCA-122, 136 N.M. 440, 99 P.3d 690.  
Time limitation not denial of plain and speedy remedy. — Fact that this section limits claims for refund to periods three years from the end of the calendar year in which payment of the New Mexico income tax was due did not deny plaintiffs a plain, speedy and efficient remedy under New Mexico law so as to invoke federal jurisdiction in tax refund case. Lung v. O'Cheskey, 358 F. Supp. 928 (D.N.M.), aff'd, 414 U.S. 802, 94 S. Ct. 159, 38 L. Ed. 2d 39 (1973).  
Enactment of limitation not impermissible exercise of state's legislative power. — The enactment of a statute fixing a period of limitations within which to sue the state for a refund does not constitute an impermissible exercise of legislative power of a state. When a statute creates a substantive right and in connection therewith specifies the time within which an action for the enforcement thereof must be instituted, upon failure to institute the action within the specified period, not only the remedy, but the right of action itself, is extinguished. United States v. Bureau of Revenue, 217 F. Supp. 849 (D.N.M. 1963).  
Failure to institute action constitutes waiver of protest. — Failure of the atomic energy commission, which had become subrogated to the rights of certain uranium producers to protest the imposition of certain taxes on the proceeds of the uranium sold to it, to bring suit within four months constituted a waiver of the protest and of all claims against the state on account of any illegality in the tax so paid, since the statute created the substantive right to sue the state for a refund and fixed the time within which suit for the enforcement of the right must be instituted. U.S. v. Bureau of Revenue, 217 F. Supp. 849 (D.N.M. 1963).  
Estoppel. — Where the department did not make any written representations during the 210-day period about how taxpayers should proceed, and department representative's statements merely informed parties' accountant to wait to see the manner in which the department would decide the issue, such a generic, oral representation does not provide a basis for estoppel. Kilmer v. Goodwin, 2004-NMCA-122, 136 N.M. 440, 99 P.3d 690.  
No offset of overpayment against prior liability. — No statute expressly authorizes the taxation and revenue department to apply overpayments of taxes for one reporting period as offsets against underpayments for another prior reporting period. In fact, the legislature has granted the department only the specific authority to credit refunds or overpayments of gas production taxes against future tax payments. The department complied with this provision by allowing taxpayer to net out its overpayment against current tax liabilities on the estimated tax term form when taxpayer filed its amended form reporting an overpayment of taxes for a prior reporting period. Amoco Prod. Co. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1994-NMCA-086, 118 N.M. 72, 878 P.2d 1021.  
Section not applicable to real property taxes. — Refund procedures of this section are not applicable to real property taxes. Lovelace Ctr. for Health Sciences v. Beach, 1980-NMCA-004, 93 N.M. 793, 606 P.2d 203.

7-1-27. Conclusiveness of court order on liability for payment of tax.

7-1-28. Authority for abatements of assessments of tax. 
A. In response to a written protest against an assessment, submitted in accordance with the provisions of Section 7-1-24 NMSA 1978, but before any court acquires jurisdiction of the matter, or when a "notice of assessment of taxes" is incorrect, the secretary or the secretary's delegate may abate any part of an assessment determined by the secretary or the secretary's delegate to have been incorrectly, erroneously or illegally made. An abatement in the amount of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) or more shall be made with the prior approval of the attorney general; except that the secretary or the secretary's delegate may make abatements with respect to the Oil and Gas Severance Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 29 NMSA 1978], the Oil and Gas Conservation Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 30 NMSA 1978], the Oil and Gas Emergency School Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 31 NMSA 1978], the Oil and Gas Ad Valorem Production Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 32 NMSA 1978], the Natural Gas Processors Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 33 NMSA 1978] or the Oil and Gas Production Equipment Ad Valorem Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 34 NMSA 1978], abatements of gasoline tax made under Section 7-13-17 NMSA 1978 and abatements of cigarette tax made under the Cigarette Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 12 NMSA 1978] without the prior approval of the attorney general regardless of the amount.  
B. Pursuant to the final order of the district court, the court of appeals, the supreme court of New Mexico or any federal court, from which order, appeal or review is not successfully taken by the department, adjudging that any person is not required to pay any portion of tax assessed to that person, the secretary or the secretary's delegate shall cause that amount of the assessment to be abated.  
C. Pursuant to a compromise of taxes agreed to by the secretary and according to the terms of the closing agreement formalizing the compromise, the secretary or the secretary's delegate shall cause the abatement of the appropriate amount of any assessment of tax.  
D. The secretary or the secretary's delegate shall cause the abatement of the amount of an assessment of tax that is equal to the amount of fee paid to or retained by an out-of-state attorney or collection agency from a judgment or the amount collected by the attorney or collection agency pursuant to Section 7-1-58 NMSA 1978.  
E. Records of abatements made in excess of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) shall be available for inspection by the public. The department shall keep such records for a minimum of three years from the date of the abatement.  
F. In response to a timely protest pursuant to Section 7-1-24 NMSA 1978 of an assessment by the department and notwithstanding any other provision of the Tax Administration Act, the secretary or the secretary's delegate may abate that portion of an assessment of tax, including applicable penalties and interest, representing the amount of tax previously paid by another person on behalf of the taxpayer on the same transaction; provided that the requirements of equitable recoupment are met. For 
purposes of this subsection, the protest pursuant to Section 7-1-24 NMSA 1978 of the department's assessment may be made by the taxpayer to whom the assessment was issued or by the other person who claims to have previously paid the tax on behalf of the taxpayer.

7-1-29. Authority to make refunds or credits. 
A. In response to a claim for refund, credit or rebate made as provided in Section 7-1-26 NMSA 1978, but before a court acquires jurisdiction of the matter, the secretary or the secretary's delegate may authorize payment to a person in the amount of the credit or rebate claimed or refund an overpayment of tax determined by the secretary or the secretary's delegate to have been erroneously made by the person, together with allowable interest.  A payment of a credit rebate claimed or a refund of tax and interest erroneously paid amounting to twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) or more shall be made with the prior approval of the attorney general, except that the secretary or the secretary's delegate may make refunds with respect to the Oil and Gas Severance Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 29 NMSA 1978], the Oil and Gas Conservation Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 30 NMSA 1978], the Oil and Gas Emergency School Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 31 NMSA 1978], the Oil and Gas Ad Valorem Production Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 32 NMSA 1978], the Natural Gas Processors Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 33 NMSA 1978] or the Oil and Gas Production Equipment Ad Valorem Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 34 NMSA 1978], Section 7-13-17 NMSA 1978 and the Cigarette Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 12 NMSA 1978] without the prior approval of the attorney general regardless of the amount. 
B. Pursuant to the final order of the district court, the court of appeals, the supreme court of New Mexico or a federal court, from which order, appeal or review is not successfully taken, adjudging that a person has properly claimed a credit, rebate or a refund of overpaid tax, the secretary shall authorize the payment to the person of the amount thereof.  After a court acquires jurisdiction but before it issues a final order, the secretary may authorize payment of a credit, rebate or refund pursuant to a closing agreement pursuant to Section 7-1-20 NMSA 1978. 
C. In the discretion of the secretary, any amount of credit or rebate to be paid or tax to be refunded may be offset against any amount of tax for which the person due to receive the credit, rebate payment or refund is liable.  The secretary or the secretary's delegate shall give notice to the taxpayer that the credit, rebate payment or refund will be made in this manner, and the taxpayer shall be entitled to interest pursuant to Section 7-1-68 NMSA 1978 until the tax liability is credited with the credit, rebate or refund amount. 
D. In an audit by the department or a managed audit covering multiple reporting periods in which both underpayments and overpayments of a tax have been made in different reporting periods, the department shall credit the tax overpayments against the underpayments; provided that the taxpayer files a claim for refund of the overpayments.  An overpayment shall be applied as a credit first to the earliest underpayment and then to succeeding underpayments.  An underpayment of tax to which an overpayment is credited pursuant to this section shall be deemed paid in the period in which the overpayment was made or the period to which the overpayment was credited against an 
underpayment, whichever is later.  If the overpayments credited pursuant to this section exceed the underpayments of a tax, the amount of the net overpayment for the periods covered in the audit shall be refunded to the taxpayer. 
E. When a taxpayer makes a payment identified to a particular return or assessment, and the department determines that the payment exceeds the amount due pursuant to that return or assessment, the secretary may apply the excess to the taxpayer's other liabilities pursuant to the tax acts to which the return or assessment applies, without requiring the taxpayer to file a claim for a refund.  The liability to which an overpayment is applied pursuant to this section shall be deemed paid in the period in which the overpayment was made or the period to which the overpayment was applied, whichever is later. 
F. If the department determines, upon review of an original or amended income tax return, corporate income and franchise tax return, estate tax return, special fuels excise tax return or oil and gas tax return, that there has been an overpayment of tax for the taxable period to which the return or amended return relates in excess of the amount due to be refunded to the taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of Subsection K of Section 7-1-26 NMSA 1978, the department may refund that excess amount to the taxpayer without requiring the taxpayer to file a refund claim. 
G. Records of refunds and credits made in excess of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) shall be available for inspection by the public.  The department shall keep such records for a minimum of three years from the date of the refund or credit. 
H. In response to a timely refund claim pursuant to Section 7-1-26 NMSA 1978 and notwithstanding any other provision of the Tax Administration Act, the secretary or the secretary's delegate may refund or credit a portion of an assessment of tax paid, including applicable penalties and interest representing the amount of tax previously paid by another person on behalf of the taxpayer on the same transaction; provided that the requirements of equitable recoupment are met.  For purposes of this subsection, the refund claim may be filed by the taxpayer to whom the assessment was issued or by another person who claims to have previously paid the tax on behalf of the taxpayer.  Prior to granting the refund or credit, the secretary may require a waiver of all rights to claim a refund or credit of the tax previously paid by another person paying a tax on behalf of the taxpayer. 
I. If, as a result of an audit by the department or a managed audit, a person is determined to owe gross receipts tax on receipts from the sale of property or services, the department may credit against the amount owed an amount of compensating tax paid by the purchaser if the person can demonstrate that the purchaser timely paid the compensating tax on the same property or services.  The credit provided by this subsection shall not be denied solely because the purchaser cannot timely file for a refund of the compensating tax paid and, if the credit is to be granted, the department shall require, for the purpose of granting the credit, that the purchaser give up any right to claim a refund of that tax.

Director (secretary) was within his discretion in applying amount wrongfully paid to the amount he determined to be owing. G.M. Shupe, Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1976-NMCA-040, 89 N.M. 265, 550 P.2d 277, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 321, 551 P.2d 1368.  
No offset of overpayment against prior liability. — No statute expressly authorizes the taxation and revenue department to apply overpayments of taxes for one reporting period as offsets against underpayments for another prior reporting period. In fact, the legislature has granted the department only the specific authority to credit refunds or overpayments of gas production taxes against future tax payments. The department complied with this provision by allowing taxpayer to net out its overpayment against current tax liabilities on the estimated tax term form when taxpayer filed its amended form reporting an overpayment of taxes for a prior reporting period.

Calculating interest on underpayment. — Interest on underpayment of taxes is calculated without regard to receipt by the taxation and revenue department of any overpayment of taxes.

Any person in possession of or obligated with respect to property or rights to property subject to levy upon which a levy has been made shall surrender the property or rights, or discharge such obligation, to the secretary or the secretary's delegate, except that part of the property or right as is, at the time of such demand, the subject of a bona fide attachment, execution, levy or other similar process, unless the person is entitled to and does redeem it according to the provisions of Section 7-1-47 NMSA 1978.

C. Any person who wrongfully fails or refuses to surrender or redeem, as required by this section, any property or rights to property levied upon, upon demand by the secretary or the secretary's delegate, is liable for a civil penalty in an amount equal to the lesser of the value of the property or rights not so surrendered or the amount of the taxes for the collection of which such levy has been made.

(a) the person who is the subject of the temporary restraining order has been given notice of the hearing for the injunction as required by law;  
(b) a demand by the department has been made upon the taxpayer to furnish security;  
(c) the taxpayer has not furnished security; and  
(d) the secretary considers the collection from the person primarily responsible for the total amount of tax due or reasonably expected to become due to be in jeopardy.  
D. A temporary restraining order or injunction shall not issue by provision of this section against any person who has furnished security in accordance with the provisions of Section 7-1-54 NMSA 1978. Upon a showing to the court by any person against whom a temporary restraining order or writ of injunction has issued by provision of this section that that person has furnished security in accordance with the provisions of Section 7-1-54 NMSA 1978, the court shall dissolve or set aside the temporary restraining order or injunction.

B. If, after notice of a requirement that he furnish security, any person neglects or refuses to comply, the department may demand of him by certified mail or in person that he furnish security in a stated amount. Upon the failure of any person to comply within ten days of the date of the making of such demand upon him for the furnishing of security, the secretary may institute a proceeding to enjoin him from doing business as provided in Section 7-1-53 NMSA 1978.

D. The secretary may require taxpayers who protest, in accordance with Section 7-1-24 NMSA 1978, an assessment or the payment of any tax administered by the department under Subsection B of Section 7-1-2 NMSA 1978 to furnish security pursuant to this section with respect to amounts in excess of two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) whenever the total amount protested, whether by a single protest or a series of protests by a single taxpayer with respect to one or more tax acts administered by the department under Subsection B of Section 7-1-2 NMSA 1978, exceeds two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000). If the taxpayer fails to provide security as required by this subsection, the department may take all appropriate actions authorized by the Tax Administration Act to collect the amount assessed, provided that any proceeds collected shall be held as the security required by this subsection until the protest is resolved.

7-1-59. Jeopardy assessments. 
A. If the secretary at any time reasonably believes that the collection of any tax for which a taxpayer is liable will be jeopardized by delay, the secretary may immediately make a jeopardy assessment of the amount of tax the payment of which to the state the secretary believes to be in jeopardy.  
B. A jeopardy assessment is effective upon the delivery, in person or by certified mail, to the taxpayer against whom the liability for tax is asserted, of a document entitled "notice of jeopardy assessment of taxes", issued in the name of the secretary, stating the nature and amount of the taxes assertedly owed by the taxpayer to the state, demanding of the taxpayer the immediate payment of that amount of tax and briefly informing the taxpayer of the steps that may be taken against the taxpayer as well as of the remedies available to the taxpayer.  
C. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Tax Administration Act, if any taxpayer against whom a jeopardy assessment has been made neglects or refuses either to pay the amount of tax demanded of the taxpayer or furnish satisfactory security therefor within five days of the service upon the taxpayer of the notice of jeopardy assessment, the secretary may immediately proceed to collect the tax by levy, as provided in Section 7-1-31 NMSA 1978, on sufficient property of the taxpayer to satisfy the deficiency, protect the interests of the state by, as provided in Section 7-1-53 NMSA 1978, enjoining the taxpayer from doing business in New Mexico or both.

taxes assessed, as provided in Section 7-1-54 NMSA 1978.

Question of fact whether business was sold or purchased. — Whether previous owner sold out its business and whether plaintiff purchased that business is a question of fact and, accordingly, this court examines the facts.

Duty is on the successor in business to cover tax liability. — This statute places the duty on the successor who acquires the business from the entity liable for the taxes to set aside from the purchase price, or other sources, sufficient funds to cover any remaining tax liability from the previous owner. The policy behind placing this duty on the successor is to secure collection of taxes by imposing derivative liability on purchasers of a business who are generally in a better financial position to collect or pay the tax from the sale price than the seller quitting the business.

7-1-63. Assessment of tax due; application of payment. 
A. If, after any business is transferred to a successor, any tax from operating the business for which the former owner is liable remains due, the successor shall pay the amount due within thirty days. If the successor fails to pay within thirty days of the date notice provided for in Section 7-1-62 NMSA 1978 was mailed or if a certificate was not requested, the department shall assess the successor the amount due.  
B. Upon the payment of the amount due from the amount placed in a trust account as provided by Subsection C of Section 7-1-61 NMSA 1978, the balance, if any, remaining may be released to the former owner or otherwise lawfully disposed of. The former owner shall be credited with the payment of tax.  
C. A successor may discharge an assessment made pursuant to this section by paying to the department the full value of the transferred tangible and intangible property. The successor shall remain liable for the amount assessed, however, until the amount is paid if:

(2) the transfer of the business amounts to a de facto merger, consolidation or mere continuation of the transferor's business; or  
(3) the successor has assumed the liability.

"Successor" defined. — A successor means any transferee of a business or property of a business, except to the extent it would be materially inconsistent with the rights of secured creditors that have perfected security interests or other perfected liens on the business or property of the business. Implicit in the taxation and revenue department’s definition of "successor" is the notion that the future intent of a transferee of a business, once it has received the business, is an important aspect of determining whether it is a "successor". A successor may include a business that is acquired and run for an indefinite period by a creditor of the predecessor, but does not include one who acquires and operates a business for a limited period of time in order to protect its collateral. The distinguishing feature is whether the entity acquiring the business intends to retain and operate the business. Hi-Country Buick GMC v. N.M.

Therefore, whatever interest that was not part of the fee and could be taxed as separate from the fee interest of the Indians was taxable by the state, but any tax that purported to touch or create a lien on the land could not be levied by the state.

No offset of overpayment against prior liability. — Interest on underpayment of taxes is calculated without regard to receipt by the taxation and revenue department of any overpayment of taxes. The department, once a claim for refund is made, is authorized only to allow a taxpayer claiming a refund for overpayment of gas production taxes to credit the refund against current or future tax liabilities.

7-1-69. Civil penalty for failure to pay tax or file a return. 
A. Except as provided in Subsection C of this section, in the case of failure due to negligence or disregard of department rules and regulations, but without intent to evade or defeat a tax, to pay when due the amount of tax required to be paid, to pay in accordance with the provisions of Section 7-1-13.1 NMSA 1978 when required to do so or to file by the date required a return regardless of whether a tax is due, there shall be added to the amount assessed a penalty in an amount equal to the greater of: 
(1) two percent per month or any fraction of a month from the date the tax was due multiplied by the amount of tax due but not paid, not to exceed twenty percent of the tax due but not paid; 
(2) two percent per month or any fraction of a month from the date the return was required to be filed multiplied by the tax liability established in the late return, not to exceed twenty percent of the tax liability established in the late return; or 
(3) a minimum of five dollars ($5.00), but the five-dollar ($5.00) minimum penalty shall not apply to taxes levied under the Income Tax Act, Corporate Income and Franchise Tax Act or taxes administered by the department pursuant to Subsection B of Section 7-1-2 NMSA 1978. 
B. No penalty shall be assessed against a taxpayer if the failure to pay an amount of tax when due results from a mistake of law made in good faith and on reasonable grounds. 
C. If a different penalty is specified in a compact or other interstate agreement to which New Mexico is a party, the penalty provided in the compact or other interstate agreement shall be applied to amounts due under the compact or other interstate agreement at the rate and in the manner prescribed by the compact or other interstate agreement. 
D. In the case of failure, with willful intent to evade or defeat a tax, to pay when due the amount of tax required to be paid, there shall be added to the amount fifty percent of the tax or a minimum of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), whichever is greater, as penalty. 
E. If demand is made for payment of a tax, including penalty imposed pursuant to this section, and if the tax is paid within ten days after the date of such demand, no penalty shall be imposed for the period after the date of the demand with respect to the amount paid. 
F. If a taxpayer makes electronic payment of a tax but the payment does not include all of the information required by the department pursuant to the provisions of Section 7-1-13.1 NMSA 1978 and if the department does not receive the required information within five business days from the later of the date a request by the department for that information is received by the taxpayer or the due date, the taxpayer shall be subject to a penalty of two percent per month or any fraction of a month from the fifth day following the date the request is received.  If a penalty is imposed under Subsection A of this section with respect to the same transaction for the same period, no penalty shall be imposed under this subsection. 
G. No penalty shall be imposed on: 
(1) tax due in excess of tax paid in accordance with an approved estimated basis pursuant to Section 7-1-10 NMSA 1978;  
(2) tax due as the result of a managed audit; or 
(3) tax that is deemed paid by crediting overpayments found in an audit or managed audit of multiple periods pursuant to Section 7-1-29 NMSA 1978.

I. GENERAL CONSIDERATION. 
Section is divided into two parts: penalty for fraud and penalty for negligence. Stohr v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1976-NMCA-118, 90 N.M. 43, 559 P.2d 420, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 254, 561 P.2d 1347 (1977) (decided under prior law).  
Presumption of correctness, in 7-1-17 NMSA 1978, also applies to this penalty section. Tiffany Constr. Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1976-NMCA-127, 90 N.M. 16, 558 P.2d 1155, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 255, 561 P.2d 1348 (1977).  
Penalty provision not denial of equal protection. — Penalties imposed on taxpayers based upon negligent failure to pay taxes when due did not deny the taxpayers equal protection of the law. Gathings v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-016, 87 N.M. 334, 533 P.2d 107.  
The date of assessment determines the applicable penalty to be imposed. — The statutory penalty is determined at the time of assessment and the law in place at the time of assessment governs the penalty to be imposed. GEA Integrated Cooling Technology v. N.M. Taxation & Rev. Dep’t, 2012-NMCA-010, 268 P.3d 48.  
Application of increased penalty to prior tax period was not retroactive. — The application of a new statutory penalty in place at the time of the assessment of tax liabilities that arose for tax periods occurring prior to the effective date of the statutory amendment that imposes the new penalty gives the amendment proper prospective effect. GEA Integrated Cooling Technology v. N.M. Taxation & Rev. Dep’t, 2012-NMCA-010, 268 P.3d 48.  
The date of assessment determines the applicable penalty to be imposed. — Where the taxpayer failed to pay gross receipts taxes for periods between June 1, 2006 and July 1, 2007; effective January 1, 2008, the legislature increased the maximum statutory penalty to twenty percent of the amount of unpaid taxes; prior to January 1, 2008, the maximum statutory penalty was ten percent; and in 2009, the N.M. taxation and revenue department assessed the taxpayer for unpaid taxes due for periods June 1, 2006 and July 1, 2007 and imposed the twenty percent penalty, the new statutory penalty of twenty percent was the applicable maximum penalty, because it was in effect at the time of the outstanding taxes were assessed. GEA Integrated Cooling Technology v. N.M. Taxation & Rev. Dep’t, 2012-NMCA-010, 268 P.3d 48.  
Every person is charged with reasonable duty to ascertain possible tax consequences of his action. This can be done by consultation with one's legal advisor. Tiffany Constr. Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1976-NMCA-127, 90 N.M. 16, 558 P.2d 1155, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 255, 561 P.2d 1348 (1977).  
Responsibility to ascertain tax consequences. — Every person is charged with the reasonable duty to ascertain the possible tax consequences of his action or inaction, and a taxpayer cannot abdicate this responsibility merely by appointing an accountant as its agent in tax matters. El Centro Villa Nursing Ctr. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1989-NMCA-070, 108 N.M. 795, 779 P.2d 982.  
II. NEGLIGENCE. 
Taxpayers were not negligent in failing to pay natural gas processor's tax on operation which removed carbon dioxide from coal seam gas where, at the time the applicable tax was enacted, coal seam gas was not processed and the applicable tax law accordingly did not directly address whether the removal of carbon dioxide from 
coal seam gas constituted "processing." Amoco Prod. Co. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2003-NMCA-092, 134 N.M. 162, 74 P.3d 96.  
Propriety of penalty. — Taxpayer's penalty was proper where her failure to pay gross receipts tax was negligent based on the hearing officer's finding that the failure was due to the taxpayer's lack of knowledge and her erroneous belief that gross receipts tax was not due on certain transactions. Grogan v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2003-NMCA-033, 133 N.M. 354, 62 P.3d 1236, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 413, 63 P.3d 516.  
Reliance on manufacturer's advice. — Where taxpayer, who operated a retail tobacco store, failed to pay gross receipts tax from buy-down and shelf-display contracts with cigarette manufacturers in reliance upon discussions of taxpayer's tax liability with the manufacturers was negligent because taxpayer did not reasonably attempt to determine whether taxpayer's actions were justifiable under the tax statutes and regulations. Grogan v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2002, NMCA-033, 133 N.M. 354, 62 P.3d 1236, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 413, 63 P.3d 516.  
Minimum penalty for negligence when no tax due under equitable recoupment. — When the amount erroneously paid by the taxpayer for a particular tax equals the amount that should have been paid for another tax and, under the doctrine of equitable recoupment, no further sums are due from the taxpayer, there is no basis for assessing a penalty as a percentage of the tax due, but the taxpayer may be required to pay the $5 minimum penalty if the error resulted from the taxpayer's negligence. Teco Invs. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1998-NMCA-055, 125 N.M. 103, 957 P.2d 532.  
Ordinary business care required. — Taxpayer was liable for civil penalties when taxpayer's failure to pay the gross receipts tax due was based on its erroneous beliefs, inattention, inaction where action would be reasonably required, or a failure to exercise the degree of ordinary business care that similarly situated businesses would exercise. Arco Materials, Inc. v. State, Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1994-NMCA-062, 118 N.M. 12, 878 P.2d 330, rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Blaze Constr. Co. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1994-NMSC-110, 118 N.M. 647, 884 P.2d 803, cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1016, 115 S. Ct. 1359, 131 L. Ed. 2d 216 (1995).  
Negligence not excused by actions of auditors. — A negligence penalty assessed against a taxpayer for its total failure to pay any compensating tax for a period of years was proper, since the taxpayer's sole excuse was that the failure to pay the tax was not uncovered by the accountants who certified the accuracy of the taxpayer's financial statements for the annual reports to shareholders required by federal securities law. The taxpayer offered no evidence that the outside auditors reviewed the taxpayer's monthly state tax returns, did not explain why the audit for the annual reports should have uncovered the failure to pay the compensating tax, and did not explain why the failure of the auditors to discover the error would excuse the taxpayer's failure to comply with clear state law. Vivigen, Inc. v. Minzner, 1994-NMCA-027, 117 N.M. 224, 870 P.2d 1382.  
Substantial evidence of negligence. — Substantial evidence supported hearing officer's finding that nursing home's failure to pay tax was due to negligence, since the home failed to show the hearing officer that it acted reasonably in not reporting a medicaid readjustment to income payments as gross receipts. El Centro Villa Nursing Ctr. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1989-NMCA-070, 108 N.M. 795, 779 P.2d 982.  
Taxpayer's erroneous belief tantamount to negligence. — A taxpayer's mere belief that he is not liable to pay taxes is tantamount to negligence within the meaning of this section and invocation of the penalty is appropriate. C & D Trailer Sales v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1979-NMCA-151, 93 N.M. 697, 604 P.2d 835.  
Taxpayer's erroneous belief and no further investigation constituted negligence. — When taxpayer, an Arizona corporation headquartered in Phoenix, failed to file a return for work performed on the Navajo reservation within New Mexico (the first road job taxpayer had done in New Mexico), its belief that no taxes were due and that there were no taxes that they had to file for or register for, without further investigation, constituted negligence so as to justify the penalty imposed. Tiffany Constr. Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1976-NMCA-127, 90 N.M. 16, 558 P.2d 1155, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 255, 561 P.2d 1348 (1977).  
"Negligent" means indifferent, careless or off-hand or lacking reasonable cause. Tiffany Constr. Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1976-NMCA-127, 90 N.M. 16, 558 P.2d 1155, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 255, 561 P.2d 1348 (1977).  
Negligence is general standard defining director's duties. — "Negligence" as used in Subsection A is a general standard capable of reasonable application and sufficient to limit and define the commissioner's (now director's) powers in imposing a penalty. Gathings v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-016, 87 N.M. 334, 533 P.2d 107.  
Negligence should be equated with federal standard. — "Negligence," as used in Subsection A, should be equated with the federal standard of "lack of reasonable cause" as set forth in 26 U.S.C. § 6651(a). Gathings v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-016, 87 N.M. 334, 533 P.2d 107.  
III. PROTEST. 
Evidence of diligent protest based on informed consultation and advice. — Conclusory and self-serving statements in affidavits of an officer of the taxpayer and a tax attorney were insufficient to give rise to a genuine issue of material fact as to the existence of any acceptable ground for excusing the taxpayer's failure to report and pay gross receipts tax. Sonic Indus., Inc. v. State, 2000-NMCA-087, 129 N.M. 657, 11 P.3d 1219, rev'd on other grounds, 2006-NMSC-038, 140 N.M. 212, 141 P.3d 1266.  
"Diligent protest" negates negligence. — When a taxpayer's failure to pay taxes is the result of a "diligent protest" and his decision to challenge a tax is based on informed consultation and advice (i.e., from his attorney or accountant), the taxpayer negates any 
inference of negligence and the application of the penalty provision is inappropriate. C & D Trailer Sales v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1979-NMCA-151, 93 N.M. 697, 604 P.2d 835.  
Reasonable doubt negates disregard of rules. — Penalty was improperly assessed and taxpayer is not liable for penalty and interest where diligent protest by the taxpayer negated the possibility of negligence, and the taxpayer did not disregard the rules and regulations because there was reasonable doubt as to the correctness of the taxes imposed by the commissioner (now secretary). Stohr v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1976-NMCA-118, 90 N.M. 43, 559 P.2d 420, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 254, 561 P.2d 1347 (1977).  
Not negligence to protest rulings or disregard where reasonable doubt. — This section provides that a penalty shall be added to the amount owed only in the event of failure to pay an assessed amount due to negligence or disregard of rules and regulations. Taxpayers were neither negligent nor heedless of any rules and regulations where they carried forward a thorough protest against the rulings of the commissioner (now secretary) with reasonable doubt as to the interpretation and applicability of the various taxes sought to be imposed by his order.

A. Upon timely receipt of a tax protest filed in accordance with the provisions of Section 7-1-24 NMSA 1978, the taxation and revenue department shall promptly acknowledge the protest by letter to the protesting taxpayer or the taxpayer's representative.  If the department determines that the protest has not been filed in accordance with that section, the department shall, within twenty-one days of receipt of the protest, inform the taxpayer of the deficiency and provide the taxpayer, within twenty-one days of the taxpayer being informed, one opportunity to correct it.  If the taxpayer corrects the deficiency, the protest shall be considered timely if the initial protest was filed within ninety days in accordance with Subsection D of Section 7-1-24 NMSA 1978.

B. Within one hundred eighty days, but no earlier than sixty days after the date of the protest, the taxation and revenue department shall request a hearing with the administrative hearings office.

In the event the taxpayer first requests a hearing with the administrative hearings office, the taxation and revenue department shall, within thirty days of service of the taxpayer's request for a hearing, file its answer to the protest describing the legal and factual bases supporting the department's position beyond an assertion of the presumption of correctness.  The department may amend its answer to the protest up until ten days before the scheduled hearing or other deadline specified in a controlling scheduling order; provided that if the administrative hearings office determines that the department's amended answer unfairly prejudices the taxpayer, the administrative hearings office may disallow the amended answer.  The hearing shall be limited to the grounds provided in the taxpayer's protest letter and in the department's answer to the protest. 
E. If the hearing officer finds that the taxation and revenue department failed to comply with the deadlines set forth in Subsections A and B of this section, the hearing officer may order that no further interest may accrue on the protested liability. 
F. If the taxpayer files the request for a hearing, the chief hearing officer shall set a hearing to take place within ninety days of the taxation and revenue department's answer to the protest, but in no case later than one hundred twenty days after the taxpayer's request for a hearing.  If the department files the request for hearing with the answer to the protest, the chief hearing officer shall set a hearing to take place within ninety days of that request.  Absent a conflict of interest requiring the assigned hearing officer to recuse from the case pursuant to the administrative hearings office code of conduct or an unforeseen emergency circumstance such as an accident, unexpected medical condition or illness, or vacancy of the position of the assigned hearing officer, the chief hearing officer shall not reassign a hearing officer to a case without giving the department and the taxpayer notice of that reassignment at least fourteen days before the hearing.  Either party may, within ten days of notice of hearing assigning a hearing officer or notice of reassignment of a hearing officer, exercise one time the peremptory right to excuse the hearing officer designated to conduct the hearing; provided that the party has not moved for a discretionary ruling from the assigned hearing officer, nor previously exercised its right of peremptory excusal.  Once a hearing officer has been peremptorily excused, that hearing officer shall not be assigned to the case again. 
G. The administrative hearings office shall rule on a dispositive motion, including a motion for summary judgment, a motion for partial summary judgment or a motion to dismiss, filed by the taxation and revenue department or the taxpayer at least thirty days before the hearing unless the parties consent to a different deadline in a scheduling order.

A. Except as otherwise provided in this section, an individual who is required to file an income tax return under the Income Tax Act shall pay the required annual payment in installments through either withholding or estimated tax payments.  
B. For the purposes of this section:  
(1) "required annual payment" means the lesser of:  
(a) ninety percent of the tax shown on the return of the taxable year or, if no return is filed, ninety percent of the tax for the taxable year; or  
(b) one hundred percent of the tax shown on the return for the preceding taxable year if the preceding taxable year was a taxable year of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a New Mexico tax return for that preceding taxable year; and  
(2) "tax" means the tax imposed under Section 7-2-3 NMSA 1978 less any amount allowed for applicable credits and rebates provided by the Income Tax Act.  
C. There shall be four required installments for each taxable year. If a taxpayer is not liable for estimated tax payments on March 31, but becomes liable for estimated tax at some point after March 31, the taxpayer must make estimated tax payments as follows:  
(1) if the taxpayer becomes required to pay estimated tax after March 31 and before June 1, fifty percent of the required annual payment must be paid on or before 
June 15, twenty-five percent on September 15 and twenty-five percent on or before January 15 of the following taxable year;  
(2) if the taxpayer becomes required to pay estimated tax after May 31, but before September 1, the taxpayer must pay seventy-five percent of the required annual payment on or before September 15 and twenty-five percent on or before January 15 of the following taxable year; and

D. Except as otherwise provided in this section, for taxpayers reporting on a calendar year basis, estimated payments of the required annual payment are due on or before April 15, June 15 and September 15 of the taxable year and January 15 of the following taxable year. For taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year other than a calendar year, the due dates for the installments are the fifteenth day of the fourth, sixth and ninth months of the fiscal year and the fifteenth day of the first month following the fiscal year.  
E. A rancher or farmer who expects to receive at least two-thirds of the rancher's or farmer's gross income for the taxable year from ranching or farming, or who has received at least two-thirds of the rancher's or farmer's gross income for the previous taxable year from ranching or farming, may:  
(1) pay the required annual payment for the taxable year in one installment on or before January 15 of the following taxable year; or  
(2) on or before March 1 of the following taxable year, file a return for the taxable year and pay in full the amount computed on the return as payable.  
A penalty under Subsection G of this section shall not be imposed unless the rancher or farmer underpays the tax by more than one-third. If a joint return is filed, a rancher or farmer must consider the rancher's or farmer's spouse's gross income in determining whether at least two-thirds of gross income is from ranching or farming.

An equal part of the amount of withheld tax shall be deemed paid on each due date for the applicable taxable year unless the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld. In that case, the amounts withheld shall be deemed payments of estimated tax on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld. The taxpayer may apply the provisions of this subsection separately to wage withholding and any other amounts withheld under the Withholding Tax Act or the Oil and Gas Proceeds and 
Pass-Through Entity Withholding Tax Act. Amounts of tax paid by taxpayers pursuant to Section 7-3A-3 NMSA 1978 shall not be deemed a payment of estimated tax.  
G. Except as otherwise provided in this section, in the case of an underpayment of the required annual payment by a taxpayer, there shall be added to the tax a penalty determined by applying the rate specified in Subsection B of Section 7-1-67 NMSA 1978 to the amount of the underpayment for the period of the underpayment, provided:  
(1) the amount of the underpayment shall be the excess of the amount of the required annual payment over the amount, if any, paid on or before the due date for the installment;  
(2) the period of the underpayment runs from the due date for the installment to whichever of the following dates is earlier:  
(a) the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the close of the taxable year; or  
(b) with respect to any portion of the underpayment, the date on which the portion was paid; and  
(3) a payment of estimated tax shall be credited against unpaid or underpaid installments in the order in which the installments are required to be paid.  
H. No penalty shall be imposed under Subsection G of this section for any taxable year if:  
(1) the difference between the following is less than one thousand dollars ($1,000):  
(a) the tax shown on the return for the taxable year or, when no return is filed, the tax for the taxable year; and  
(b) any amount withheld under the provisions of the Withholding Tax Act or the Oil and Gas Proceeds and Pass-Through Entity Withholding Tax Act for that taxpayer for that taxable year;  
(2) the taxpayer's preceding taxable year was a taxable year of twelve months, the taxpayer did not have a tax liability for the preceding taxable year and the taxpayer was a resident of New Mexico for the entire taxable year;  
(3) through either withholding or estimated tax payments, the taxpayer paid the required annual payment as defined in Subsection B of this section; or  
(4) the secretary determines that the underpayment was not due to fraud, negligence or disregard of rules and regulations.  
I. If on or before January 31 of the following taxable year the taxpayer files a return for the taxable year and pays in full the amount computed on the return as payable, then a penalty under Subsection G of this section shall not be imposed on an underpayment of the fourth required installment for the taxable year.  
J. This section applies to taxable years of less than twelve months and to taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year other than a calendar year in the manner determined by regulation or instruction of the secretary.  
K. Except as otherwise provided in Subsection L of this section, this section applies to any estate or trust.  
L. This section does not apply to any trust that is subject to the tax imposed by Section 511 of the Internal Revenue Code or that is a private foundation. For a taxable year that ends before the date two years after the date of the decedent's death, this section does not apply to:  
(1) the estate of the decedent; or  
(2) any trust all of which was treated under Subpart E of Part I of Subchapter J of Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code as owned by the decedent and to which the residue of the decedent's estate will pass under the decedent's will or, if no will is admitted to probate, that is the trust primarily responsible for paying debts, taxes and expenses of administration.

E. If a taxpayer's modified gross income is zero, the taxpayer may claim a credit in the amount shown in the first row of the table appropriate for the taxpayer's number of exemptions as adjusted by the provisions of Subsection F of this section. 
F. For the 2022 taxable year and each subsequent taxable year, the amount of rebate shown in the table in Subsection D of this section shall be adjusted to account for inflation.  The department shall make the adjustment by multiplying each amount of rebate by a fraction, the numerator of which is the consumer price index ending during 
the prior taxable year and the denominator of which is the consumer price index ending in tax year 2021.  The result of the multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest one dollar ($1.00), except that if the result would be an amount less than the corresponding amount for the preceding taxable year, then no adjustment shall be made.  
G. The tax rebates provided for in this section may be deducted from the taxpayer's New Mexico income tax liability for the taxable year.  If the tax rebates exceed the taxpayer's income tax liability, the excess shall be refunded to the taxpayer. 
H. For purposes of this section: 
(1) "consumer price index" means the consumer price index for all urban consumers published by the United States department of labor for the month ending September 30; and 
(2) "dependent" means "dependent" as defined by Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as that section may be amended or renumbered, but also includes any minor child or stepchild of the resident who would be a dependent for federal income tax purposes if the public assistance contributing to the support of the child or stepchild was considered to have been contributed by the resident.

I. The tax rebate provided for in this section may be deducted from the taxpayer's New Mexico income tax liability for the taxable year. If the tax rebate exceeds the taxpayer's income tax liability, the excess shall be refunded to the taxpayer.  
J. The board of county commissioners may adopt a resolution authorizing otherwise qualified taxpayers whose principal place of residence is in the county to claim the rebate provided by this section in the amounts set forth in Subsection G of this section.

The resolution may apply to one or more taxable years and shall specify the period of time for which the rebate provided by this section may be claimed by qualified taxpayers. The county must adopt the resolution and notify the department of the adoption by no later than September 1 of the taxable year to which the resolution first applies. The department shall determine the additional amounts paid to taxpayers of the county for each taxable year and shall bill the county for the amount at the time and in the manner determined by the department. If the county fails to pay any bill within thirty days, the department may deduct the amount due from any amount to be transferred or distributed to the county by the state, other than debt interceptions.

A. As used in this section:  
(1) "caregiver" means a corporation or an individual eighteen years of age or over who receives compensation from a resident for providing direct care, supervision and guidance to a qualifying dependent of the resident for less than twenty-four hours daily and includes related individuals of the resident but does not include a dependent of the resident;  
(2) "cost of maintaining a household" means the expenses incurred for the mutual benefit of the occupants thereof by reason of its operation as the principal place of abode of such occupants, including property taxes, mortgage interest, rent, utility charges, upkeep and repairs, property insurance and food consumed on the premises. "Cost of maintaining a household" shall not include expenses otherwise incurred, including cost of clothing, education, medical treatment, vacations, life insurance, transportation and mortgages;  
(3) "dependent" means "dependent" as defined by Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code, as that section may be amended or renumbered, but also includes any minor child or stepchild of the resident who would be a dependent for federal income tax purposes if the public assistance contributing to the support of the child or stepchild was considered to have been contributed by the resident;  
(4) "disabled person" means a person who has a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, as certified by a licensed physician or an advanced practice registered nurse, certified nurse-midwife or physician assistant working within that person's scope of practice, that renders such person unable to engage in gainful employment;  
(5) "gainfully employed" means working for remuneration for others, either full time or part time, or self-employment in a business or partnership; and  
(6) "qualifying dependent" means a dependent under the age of fifteen at the end of the taxable year who receives the services of a caregiver.  
B. Any resident who files an individual New Mexico income tax return and who is not a dependent of another taxpayer may claim a credit for child day care expenses incurred and paid to a caregiver in New Mexico during the taxable year by such resident if the resident:  
(1) singly or together with a spouse furnishes over half the cost of maintaining the household for one or more qualifying dependents for any period in the taxable year for which the credit is claimed;  
(2) is gainfully employed for any period for which the credit is claimed or, if a joint return is filed, both spouses are gainfully employed or one is disabled for any period for which the credit is claimed;  
(3) compensates a caregiver for child day care for a qualifying dependent to enable such resident together with the resident's spouse, if any and if not disabled, to be gainfully employed;  
(4) is not a recipient of public assistance under a program of aid to families with dependent children, a program under the New Mexico Works Act [Chapter 27, Article 2B NMSA 1978] or any successor program during any period for which the credit provided by this section is claimed; and  
(5) has a modified gross income, including child support payments, if any, of not more than the annual income that would be derived from earnings at double the federal minimum wage.

If the resident taxpayer has a federal tax liability, the taxpayer shall claim from the state not more than the difference between the amount of the state child care credit for which the taxpayer is eligible and the federal credit for child and dependent care expenses the taxpayer is able to deduct from federal tax liability for the same taxable year; provided, for first year residents only, the amount of the federal credit for child and dependent care expenses may be reduced to an amount equal to the amount of federal credit for child and dependent care expenses the resident is able to deduct from federal tax liability multiplied by the ratio of the number of days of residence in New Mexico 
during the resident's taxable year to the total number of days in the resident's taxable year.  
F. The credit provided for in this section may be deducted from the taxpayer's New Mexico income tax liability for the taxable year. If the credit exceeds the taxpayer's income tax liability, the excess shall be refunded to the taxpayer.  
G. A husband and wife maintaining a household for one or more qualifying dependents and filing separate returns for a taxable year for which they could have filed a joint return:  
(1) may each claim only one-half of the credit that would have been claimed on a joint return; and  
(2) are eligible for the credit provided in this section only if their joint modified gross income, including child support payments, if any, is not more than the annual income that would be derived from earnings at double the federal minimum wage.

(2) one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or more, increments of twenty-five percent of the total credit amount in each of the four taxable years, including the taxable year for which the credit is approved and the three subsequent taxable years, shall be applied against the taxpayer's income tax liability.  
L. If the sum of all sustainable building tax credits that can be applied to a taxable year for a taxpayer, calculated according to Paragraph (1) or (2) of Subsection K of this section, exceeds the taxpayer's income tax liability for that taxable year, the excess may be carried forward for a period of up to seven years.  
M. A taxpayer who otherwise qualifies and claims a sustainable building tax credit with respect to a sustainable building owned by a partnership or other business association of which the taxpayer is a member may claim a credit only in proportion to that taxpayer's interest in the partnership or association. The total credit claimed in the aggregate by all members of the partnership or association with respect to the sustainable building shall not exceed the amount of the credit that could have been claimed by a sole owner of the property.  
N. A husband and wife who file separate returns for a taxable year in which they could have filed a joint return may each claim only one-half of the sustainable building tax credit that would have been allowed on a joint return.  
O. The department shall compile an annual report on the sustainable building tax credit created pursuant to this section that shall include the number of taxpayers approved by the department to receive the tax credit, the aggregate amount of tax credits approved and any other information necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of the tax credit. Beginning in 2015 and every five years thereafter, the department shall compile and present the annual reports to the revenue stabilization and tax policy committee and the legislative finance committee with an analysis of the effectiveness and cost of the tax credit and whether the tax credit is performing the purpose for which it was created.

development tax credit pursuant to Section 7-2-18.14 NMSA 1978 has not been claimed with respect to that system and the building owner and the taxpayer claiming the 2015 sustainable building tax credit certify that such a tax credit will not be claimed with respect to that system. 
J. To be eligible for the 2015 sustainable building tax credit, the building owner shall provide to the taxation and revenue department a certificate of eligibility issued by the energy, minerals and natural resources department pursuant to the requirements of Subsection F of this section and any other information the taxation and revenue department may require to determine the amount of the tax credit for which the building owner is eligible. 
K. If the requirements of this section have been complied with, the department shall issue to the building owner a document granting a 2015 sustainable building tax credit.  The document shall be numbered for identification and declare its date of issuance and the amount of the tax credit allowed pursuant to this section.  The document may be submitted by the building owner with that taxpayer's income tax return, if applicable, or may be sold, exchanged or otherwise transferred to another taxpayer.  The parties to such a transaction shall notify the department of the sale, exchange or transfer within ten days of the sale, exchange or transfer.  
L. If the approved amount of a 2015 sustainable building tax credit for a taxpayer in a taxable year represented by a document issued pursuant to Subsection K of this section is:

(2) one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or more, increments of twenty-five percent of the total credit amount in each of the four taxable years, including the taxable year for which the credit is approved and the three subsequent taxable years, shall be applied against the taxpayer's income tax liability.

A taxpayer who otherwise qualifies and claims a 2015 sustainable building tax credit with respect to a sustainable building owned by a partnership or other business association of which the taxpayer is a member may claim a credit only in proportion to that taxpayer's interest in the partnership or association.

sustainable building shall not exceed the amount of the credit that could have been claimed by a sole owner of the property.

C. A person who is a building owner may apply for a certificate of eligibility for the 2021 sustainable building tax credit from the energy, minerals and natural resources department after the construction, installation or renovation of the sustainable building or installation of energy-conserving products in an existing building is complete.  Applications shall be considered in the order received.  If the energy, minerals and natural resources department determines that the building owner meets the requirements of this subsection and that the building with respect to which the application is made meets the requirements of this section for a 2021 sustainable building tax credit, the energy, minerals and natural resources department may issue a certificate of eligibility to the building owner, subject to the limitations in Subsection D of this section.  The certificate shall include the rating system certification level awarded to the building, the amount of qualified occupied square footage in the building, a calculation of the maximum amount of 2021 sustainable building tax credit for which the building owner would be eligible, the identification number, date of issuance and the first taxable year that the credit shall be claimed.  The energy, minerals and natural resources department may issue rules governing the procedure for administering the 
provisions of this subsection.  If the certification level for the sustainable residential building is awarded on or after January 1, 2022, the energy, minerals and natural resources department may issue a certificate of eligibility to a building owner who is: 
(1) the owner of the sustainable residential building at the time the certification level for the building is awarded; or 
(2) the subsequent purchaser of a sustainable residential building with respect to which no tax credit has been previously claimed. 
D. Except as provided in Subsection E of this section, the energy, minerals and natural resources department may issue a certificate of eligibility only if the total amount of 2021 sustainable building tax credits represented by certificates of eligibility issued by the energy, minerals and natural resources department pursuant to this section and pursuant to the Corporate Income and Franchise Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 2A NMSA 1978] shall not exceed in any calendar year an aggregate amount of: 
(1) one million dollars ($1,000,000) with respect to the construction of new sustainable commercial buildings; 
(2) two million dollars ($2,000,000) with respect to the construction of new sustainable residential buildings that are not manufactured housing; 
(3) two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) with respect to the construction of new sustainable residential buildings that are manufactured housing; 
(4) one million dollars ($1,000,000) with respect to the renovation of large commercial buildings; and 
(5) two million nine hundred thousand dollars ($2,900,000) with respect to the installation of energy-conserving products in existing commercial buildings pursuant to Paragraph (3) of Subsection B of this section and existing residential buildings pursuant to Paragraph (5) of Subsection B of this section. 
E. For any taxable year that the energy, minerals and natural resources department determines that applications for sustainable building tax credits for any type of sustainable building pursuant to Subsection D of this section are less than the aggregate limit for that type of sustainable building for that taxable year, the energy, minerals and natural resources department shall allow the difference between the aggregate limit and the applications to be added to the aggregate limit of another type of sustainable building for which applications exceeded the aggregate limit for that taxable year.  Any excess not used in a taxable year shall not be carried forward to subsequent taxable years. 
F. Installation of a solar thermal system or a photovoltaic system eligible for the new solar market development tax credit pursuant to Section 7-2-18.31 NMSA 1978 shall not 
be used as a component of qualification for the rating system certification level used in determining eligibility for the 2021 sustainable building tax credit, unless a new solar market development tax credit pursuant to Section 7-2-18.31 NMSA 1978 has not been claimed with respect to that system and the building owner and the taxpayer claiming the 2021 sustainable building tax credit certify that such a tax credit will not be claimed with respect to that system. 
G. To claim the 2021 sustainable building tax credit, the building owner shall provide to the taxation and revenue department a certificate of eligibility issued by the energy, minerals and natural resources department pursuant to the requirements of Subsection C of this section and any other information the taxation and revenue department may require. 
H. If the approved amount of a 2021 sustainable building tax credit for a taxpayer in a taxable year represented by a document issued pursuant to Subsection C of this section is: 
(1) less than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), a maximum of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) shall be applied against the taxpayer's income tax liability for the taxable year for which the credit is approved and the next three subsequent taxable years as needed depending on the amount of credit; or 
(2) one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or more, increments of twenty-five percent of the total credit amount in each of the four taxable years, including the taxable year for which the credit is approved and the three subsequent taxable years, shall be applied against the taxpayer's income tax liability. 
I. If the sum of all 2021 sustainable building tax credits that can be applied to a taxable year for a taxpayer, calculated according to Paragraph (1) or (2) of Subsection H of this section, exceeds the taxpayer's income tax liability for that taxable year, the excess may be carried forward for a period of up to seven years; provided that if the taxpayer is a low-income taxpayer, the excess shall be refunded to the taxpayer. 
J. A taxpayer who otherwise qualifies and claims a 2021 sustainable building tax credit with respect to a sustainable building owned by a partnership or other business association of which the taxpayer is a member may claim a credit only in proportion to that taxpayer's interest in the partnership or association.  The total credit claimed in the aggregate by all members of the partnership or association with respect to the sustainable building shall not exceed the amount of the credit that could have been claimed by a sole owner of the property. 
K. Married individuals who file separate returns for a taxable year in which they could have filed a joint return may each claim only one-half of the 2021 sustainable building tax credit that would have been allowed on a joint return. 
L. If the requirements of this section have been complied with, the department shall issue to the building owner a document granting a 2021 sustainable building tax credit.  The document shall be numbered for identification and declare its date of issuance and the amount of the tax credit allowed pursuant to this section.  The document may be submitted by the building owner with that taxpayer's income tax return, if applicable, or may be sold, exchanged or otherwise transferred to another taxpayer.  The parties to such a transaction shall notify the department of the sale, exchange or transfer within ten days of the sale, exchange or transfer. 
M. The department and the energy, minerals and natural resources department shall compile an annual report on the 2021 sustainable building tax credit created pursuant to this section that shall include the number of taxpayers approved to receive the tax credit, the aggregate amount of tax credits approved and any other information necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of the tax credit.

The fair market value of qualified donations made pursuant to this section shall be substantiated by a "qualified 
appraisal" prepared by a "qualified appraiser", as those terms are defined under applicable federal laws and regulations governing charitable contributions.

Dedications of land for open space for the purpose of fulfilling density requirements to obtain subdivision or building permits shall not be considered as qualified donations pursuant to the Land Conservation Incentives Act [75-9-1 to 75-9-6 NMSA 1978].  
D.

The use and protection of the lands, or interests therein, for open space, natural area protection, biodiversity habitat conservation, land preservation, agricultural preservation, historic preservation or similar use or purpose of the property shall be assured in perpetuity.  
F. A taxpayer may apply for certification of eligibility for the tax credit provided by this section from the energy, minerals and natural resources department.

The energy, minerals and natural resources department may issue rules governing the procedure for administering the provisions of this subsection.  
G. To receive a credit pursuant to this section, a person shall apply to the taxation and revenue department on forms and in the manner prescribed by the department. The 
application shall include a certificate of eligibility issued by the energy, minerals and natural resources department pursuant to Subsection F of this section.

H. The tax credit represented by a document issued pursuant to Subsection G of this section for a conveyance made on or after January 1, 2008, or an increment of that tax credit, may be sold, exchanged or otherwise transferred, and may be carried forward for a period of twenty taxable years following the taxable year in which the credit originated until fully expended. A tax credit or increment of a tax credit may only be transferred once. The credit may be transferred to any taxpayer. A taxpayer to whom a credit has been transferred may use the credit for the taxable year in which the transfer occurred and unused amounts may be carried forward to succeeding taxable years, but in no event may the transferred credit be used more than twenty years after it was originally issued.  
I. A tax credit issued pursuant to this section shall be transferred through a qualified intermediary. The qualified intermediary shall, by means of a sworn notarized statement, notify the taxation and revenue department of the transfer and of the date of the transfer within ten days of the transfer. Credits shall only be transferred in increments of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or more. The qualified intermediary shall keep an account of the credits and have the authority to issue sub-numbers registered with the taxation and revenue department and traceable to the original credit.  
J. If a charitable deduction is claimed on the taxpayer's federal income tax for any contribution for which the credit provided by this section is claimed, the taxpayer's itemized deductions for New Mexico income tax shall be reduced by the amount of the deduction for the contribution in order to determine the New Mexico taxable income of the taxpayer.  
K. For the purposes of this section:  
(1) "qualified intermediary" does not include a person who has been previously convicted of a felony, who has had a professional license revoked, who is engaged in the practice defined in Section 61-28B-3 NMSA 1978 and who is identified in Section 61-29-2 NMSA 1978, and does not include any entity owned wholly or in part or employing any of the foregoing persons; and

A. Every taxpayer shall pay estimated corporate income tax to the state of New Mexico during its taxable year if its tax after applicable credits is five thousand dollars ($5,000) or more in the current taxable year. A taxpayer to which this section applies shall calculate estimated tax by one of the following methods:  
(1) estimating the amount of tax due, net of any credits, for the current taxable year, provided that the estimated amount is at least eighty percent of the amount determined to be due for the taxable year;  
(2) using as the estimate an amount equal to one hundred percent of the tax due for the previous taxable year, if the previous taxable year was a full twelve-month year;  
(3) using as the estimate an amount equal to one hundred ten percent of the tax due for the taxable year immediately preceding the previous taxable year, if the taxable year immediately preceding the previous taxable year was a full twelve-month year and the return for the previous taxable year has not been filed and the extended due date for filing that return has not occurred at the time the first installment is due for the taxable year; or  
(4) estimating the amount of tax due, net of any credits, for each fiscal quarter of the current taxable year, provided that the estimated amount is at least eighty percent of the amount determined to be due for that quarter.  
B. If Subsection A of this section applies, the amount of estimated tax shall be paid in installments as provided in this subsection. Twenty-five percent of the estimated tax 
calculated under Paragraph (1), (2) or (3) of Subsection A of this section or one hundred percent of the estimated tax calculated under Paragraph (4) of Subsection A of this section is due on or before the following dates: the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the taxable year, the fifteenth day of the sixth month of the taxable year, the fifteenth day of the ninth month of the taxable year and the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the taxable year. Application of this subsection to a taxable year that is a fractional part of a year shall be determined by regulation of the secretary.  
C. Every taxpayer to which Subsection A of this section applies that fails to pay the estimated tax when due or that makes estimated tax payments during the taxable year that are less than the lesser of eighty percent of the income tax imposed on the taxpayer under the Corporate Income and Franchise Tax Act or the amount required by Paragraph (2), (3) or (4) of Subsection A of this section shall be subject to the interest and penalty provisions of Sections 7-1-67 and 7-1-69 NMSA 1978 on the underpayment.  
D. For purposes of this section, the amount of underpayment shall be the excess of the amount of the installment that would be required to be paid if the estimated tax were equal to eighty percent of the tax shown on the return for the taxable year or the amount required by Paragraph (2), (3) or (4) of Subsection A of this section or, if no return was filed, eighty percent of the tax for the taxable year for which the estimated tax is due less the amount, if any, of the installment paid on or before the last date prescribed for payment.  
E. For purposes of this section, the period of underpayment shall run from the date the installment was required to be paid to whichever of the following dates is earlier:

If two or more taxpayers share in the cost of operating a child care facility primarily for the dependent children of the taxpayers' employees, each taxpayer shall be allowed a credit in relation to the taxpayer's share of the cost of operating the child care facility. Each taxpayer's share of the tax credit shall be determined by dividing the employer's share of the net cost of operating the child care facility by the number of children served and multiplying the result by the number of the taxpayer's employees' children served.

If for any taxable year the energy, minerals and natural resources department determines that the applications for sustainable building tax credits with respect to sustainable residential buildings for that taxable year exceed the aggregate limit set in this section, the energy, minerals and natural resources department may issue certificates of eligibility under the aggregate annual limit for sustainable commercial buildings to owners of sustainable residential buildings that meet the requirements of the energy, minerals and natural resources department and of 
this section; provided that applications for sustainable building credits for other sustainable commercial buildings total less than the full amount allocated for tax credits for sustainable commercial buildings.  
H. Installation of a solar thermal system or a photovoltaic system eligible for the solar market development tax credit pursuant to Section 7-2-18.14 NMSA 1978 may not be used as a component of qualification for the rating system certification level used in determining eligibility for the sustainable building tax credit, unless a solar market development tax credit pursuant to Section 7-2-18.14 NMSA 1978 has not been claimed with respect to that system and the building owner and the taxpayer claiming the sustainable building tax credit certify that such a tax credit will not be claimed with respect to that system.  
I. To be eligible for the sustainable building tax credit, the building owner shall provide to the taxation and revenue department a certificate of eligibility issued by the energy, minerals and natural resources department pursuant to the requirements of Subsection F of this section and any other information the taxation and revenue department may require to determine the amount of the tax credit for which the building owner is eligible.  
J. If the requirements of this section have been complied with, the department shall issue to the building owner a document granting a sustainable building tax credit. The document shall be numbered for identification and declare its date of issuance and the amount of the tax credit allowed pursuant to this section. The document may be submitted by the building owner with that taxpayer's income tax return, if applicable, or may be sold, exchanged or otherwise transferred to another taxpayer. The parties to such a transaction shall notify the department of the sale, exchange or transfer within ten days of the sale, exchange or transfer.

(1) less than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), a maximum of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) shall be applied against the taxpayer's corporate income tax liability for the taxable year for which the credit is approved and the next three subsequent taxable years as needed depending on the amount of credit; or  
(2) one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or more, increments of twenty-five percent of the total credit amount in each of the four taxable years, including the taxable year for which the credit is approved and the three subsequent taxable years, shall be applied against the taxpayer's corporate income tax liability.  
L. If the sum of all sustainable building tax credits that can be applied to a taxable year for a taxpayer, calculated according to Paragraph (1) or (2) of Subsection K of this 
section, exceeds the taxpayer's corporate income tax liability for that taxable year, the excess may be carried forward for a period of up to seven years.  
M. A taxpayer that otherwise qualifies and claims a sustainable building tax credit with respect to a sustainable building owned by a partnership or other business association of which the taxpayer is a member may claim a credit only in proportion to that taxpayer's interest in the partnership or association. The total credit claimed in the aggregate by all members of the partnership or association with respect to the sustainable building shall not exceed the amount of the credit that could have been claimed by a sole owner of the property.  
N. The department shall compile an annual report on the sustainable building tax credit created pursuant to this section that shall include the number of taxpayers approved by the department to receive the tax credit, the aggregate amount of tax credits approved and any other information necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of the tax credit. Beginning in 2015 and every five years thereafter, the department shall compile and present the annual reports to the revenue stabilization and tax policy committee and the legislative finance committee with an analysis of the effectiveness and cost of the tax credit and whether the tax credit is performing the purpose for which it was created.

F. A person that is a building owner may apply for a certificate of eligibility for the 2015 sustainable building tax credit from the energy, minerals and natural resources department after the construction, installation or renovation of the sustainable building is complete.  Applications shall be considered in the order received.  If the energy, minerals and natural resources department determines that the building owner meets the requirements of this subsection and that the building with respect to which the tax credit application is made meets the requirements of this section as a sustainable residential building or a sustainable commercial building, the energy, minerals and natural resources department may issue a certificate of eligibility to the building owner, subject to the limitations in Subsection G of this section.  The certificate shall include the rating system certification level awarded to the building, the amount of qualified occupied square footage in the building and a calculation of the maximum amount of 2015 sustainable building tax credit for which the building owner would be eligible.  The energy, minerals and natural resources department may issue rules governing the procedure for administering the provisions of this subsection.  If the certification level for the sustainable residential building is awarded on or after January 1, 2017 but prior to April 1, 2023, the energy, minerals and natural resources department may issue a certificate of eligibility to a building owner who is: 
(1) the owner of the sustainable residential building at the time the certification level for the building is awarded; or 
(2) the subsequent purchaser of a sustainable residential building with respect to which no tax credit has been previously claimed. 
G. Except as provided in Subsection H of this section, the energy, minerals and natural resources department may issue a certificate of eligibility only if the total amount of 2015 sustainable building tax credits represented by certificates of eligibility issued by the energy, minerals and natural resources department pursuant to this section and 
pursuant to the Income Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 2 NMSA 1978] shall not exceed in any calendar year an aggregate amount of: 
(1) one million two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($1,250,000) with respect to sustainable commercial buildings; 
(2) three million three hundred seventy-five thousand dollars ($3,375,000) with respect to sustainable residential buildings that are not manufactured housing; and 
(3) three hundred seventy-five thousand dollars ($375,000) with respect to sustainable residential buildings that are manufactured housing. 
H. For any taxable year that the energy, minerals and natural resources department determines that applications for sustainable building tax credits for any type of sustainable building pursuant to Paragraph (1), (2) or (3) of Subsection G of this section are less than the aggregate limit for that type of sustainable building for that taxable year, the energy, minerals and natural resources department shall allow the difference between the aggregate limit and the applications to be added to the aggregate limit of another type of sustainable building for which applications exceeded the aggregate limit for that taxable year.  Any excess not used in a taxable year shall not be carried forward to subsequent taxable years. 
I. Installation of a solar thermal system or a photovoltaic system eligible for the solar market development tax credit pursuant to Section 7-2-18.14 NMSA 1978 may not be used as a component of qualification for the rating system certification level used in determining eligibility for the 2015 sustainable building tax credit, unless a solar market development tax credit pursuant to Section 7-2-18.14 NMSA 1978 has not been claimed with respect to that system and the building owner and the taxpayer claiming the 2015 sustainable building tax credit certify that such a tax credit will not be claimed with respect to that system. 
J. To be eligible for the 2015 sustainable building tax credit, the building owner shall provide to the taxation and revenue department a certificate of eligibility issued by the energy, minerals and natural resources department pursuant to the requirements of Subsection F of this section and any other information the taxation and revenue department may require to determine the amount of the tax credit for which the building owner is eligible. 
K. If the requirements of this section have been complied with, the department shall issue to the building owner a document granting a 2015 sustainable building tax credit.  The document shall be numbered for identification and declare its date of issuance and the amount of the tax credit allowed pursuant to this section.  The document may be submitted by the building owner with that taxpayer's income tax return, if applicable, or may be sold, exchanged or otherwise transferred to another taxpayer.  The parties to such a transaction shall notify the department of the sale, exchange or transfer within ten days of the sale, exchange or transfer.  
L. If the approved amount of a 2015 sustainable building tax credit for a taxpayer in a taxable year represented by a document issued pursuant to Subsection K of this section is: 
(1) less than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), a maximum of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) shall be applied against the taxpayer's corporate income tax liability for the taxable year for which the credit is approved and the next three subsequent taxable years as needed depending on the amount of credit; or 
(2) one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or more, increments of twenty-five percent of the total credit amount in each of the four taxable years, including the taxable year for which the credit is approved and the three subsequent taxable years, shall be applied against the taxpayer's corporate income tax liability. 
M. If the sum of all 2015 sustainable building tax credits that can be applied to a taxable year for a taxpayer, calculated according to Paragraph (1) or (2) of Subsection L of this section, exceeds the taxpayer's corporate income tax liability for that taxable year, the excess may be carried forward for a period of up to seven years. 
N. A taxpayer that otherwise qualifies and claims a 2015 sustainable building tax credit with respect to a sustainable building owned by a partnership or other business association of which the taxpayer is a member may claim a credit only in proportion to that taxpayer's interest in the partnership or association.  The total credit claimed in the aggregate by all members of the partnership or association with respect to the sustainable building shall not exceed the amount of the credit that could have been claimed by a sole owner of the property. 
O. The department shall compile an annual report on the 2015 sustainable building tax credit created pursuant to this section that shall include the number of taxpayers approved by the department to receive the tax credit, the aggregate amount of tax credits approved and any other information necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of the tax credit.  Beginning in 2019 and every three years thereafter that the credit is in effect, the department shall compile and present the annual reports to the revenue stabilization and tax policy committee and the legislative finance committee with an analysis of the effectiveness and cost of the tax credit and whether the tax credit is performing the purpose for which it was created.

C. A person that is a building owner may apply for a certificate of eligibility for the 2021 sustainable building tax credit from the energy, minerals and natural resources department after the construction, installation or renovation of the sustainable building or installation of energy-conserving products in an existing building is complete.  Applications shall be considered in the order received.  If the energy, minerals and natural resources department determines that the building owner meets the requirements of this subsection and that the building with respect to which the application is made meets the requirements of this section for a 2021 sustainable building tax credit, the energy, minerals and natural resources department may issue a certificate of eligibility to the building owner, subject to the limitations in Subsection D of this section.  The certificate shall include the rating system certification level awarded to the building, the amount of qualified occupied square footage in the building, a calculation of the maximum amount of 2021 sustainable building tax credit for which the building owner would be eligible, the identification number, date of issuance and the first taxable year that the credit shall be claimed.  The energy, minerals and natural resources department may issue rules governing the procedure for administering the provisions of this subsection.  If the certification level for the sustainable residential building is awarded on or after January 1, 2022, the energy, minerals and natural resources department may issue a certificate of eligibility to a building owner that is: 
(1) the owner of the sustainable residential building at the time the certification level for the building is awarded; or 
(2) the subsequent purchaser of a sustainable residential building with respect to which no tax credit has been previously claimed. 
D. Except as provided in Subsection E of this section, the energy, minerals and natural resources department may issue a certificate of eligibility only if the total amount of 2021 sustainable building tax credits represented by certificates of eligibility issued by the energy, minerals and natural resources department pursuant to this section and pursuant to the Income Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 2 NMSA 1978] shall not exceed in any calendar year an aggregate amount of: 
(1) one million dollars ($1,000,000) with respect to the construction of new sustainable commercial buildings; 
(2) two million dollars ($2,000,000) with respect to the construction of new sustainable residential buildings that are not manufactured housing; 
(3) two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) with respect to the construction of new sustainable residential buildings that are manufactured housing; 
(4) one million dollars ($1,000,000) with respect to the renovation of large commercial buildings; and 
(5) two million nine hundred thousand dollars ($2,900,000) with respect to the installation of energy-conserving products in existing commercial buildings pursuant to Paragraph (3) of Subsection B of this section and existing residential buildings pursuant to Paragraph (5) of Subsection B of this section. 
E. For any taxable year that the energy, minerals and natural resources department determines that applications for sustainable building tax credits for any type of sustainable building pursuant to Subsection D of this section are less than the aggregate limit for that type of sustainable building for that taxable year, the energy, minerals and natural resources department shall allow the difference between the aggregate limit and the applications to be added to the aggregate limit of another type of sustainable building for which applications exceeded the aggregate limit for that taxable year.  Any excess not used in a taxable year shall not be carried forward to subsequent taxable years. 
F. Installation of a solar thermal system or a photovoltaic system eligible for the new solar market development tax credit pursuant to Section 7-2-18.31 NMSA 1978 shall not be used as a component of qualification for the rating system certification level used in determining eligibility for the 2021 sustainable building tax credit, unless a new solar market development tax credit pursuant to Section 7-2-18.31 NMSA 1978 has not been claimed with respect to that system and the building owner and the taxpayer claiming the 2021 sustainable building tax credit certify that such a tax credit will not be claimed with respect to that system. 
G. To claim the 2021 sustainable building tax credit, the building owner shall provide to the taxation and revenue department a certificate of eligibility issued by the energy, minerals and natural resources department pursuant to the requirements of Subsection C of this section and any other information the taxation and revenue department may require. 
H. If the approved amount of a 2021 sustainable building tax credit for a taxpayer in a taxable year represented by a document issued pursuant to Subsection C of this section is: 
(1) less than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), a maximum of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) shall be applied against the taxpayer's corporate income tax liability for the taxable year for which the credit is approved and the next three subsequent taxable years as needed depending on the amount of credit; or 
(2) one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or more, increments of twenty-five percent of the total credit amount in each of the four taxable years, including the taxable year for which the credit is approved and the three subsequent taxable years, shall be applied against the taxpayer's corporate income tax liability. 
I. If the sum of all 2021 sustainable building tax credits that can be applied to a taxable year for a taxpayer, calculated according to Paragraph (1) or (2) of Subsection H of this section, exceeds the taxpayer's corporate income tax liability for that taxable year, the excess may be carried forward for a period of up to seven years. 
J. A taxpayer that otherwise qualifies and claims a 2021 sustainable building tax credit with respect to a sustainable building owned by a partnership or other business association of which the taxpayer is a member may claim a credit only in proportion to that taxpayer's interest in the partnership or association.  The total credit claimed in the aggregate by all members of the partnership or association with respect to the sustainable building shall not exceed the amount of the credit that could have been claimed by a sole owner of the property. 
K. If the requirements of this section have been complied with, the department shall issue to the building owner a document granting a 2021 sustainable building tax credit.  The document shall be numbered for identification and declare its date of issuance and the amount of the tax credit allowed pursuant to this section.  The document may be submitted by the building owner with that taxpayer's income tax return, if applicable, or may be sold, exchanged or otherwise transferred to another taxpayer.  The parties to such a transaction shall notify the department of the sale, exchange or transfer within ten days of the sale, exchange or transfer. 
L. The department and the energy, minerals and natural resources department shall compile an annual report on the 2021 sustainable building tax credit created pursuant to this section that shall include the number of taxpayers approved to receive the tax credit, the aggregate amount of tax credits approved and any other information necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of the tax credit.

on the return within ten days after receiving the notification from the department pursuant to Subsection C of this section. The notice to the spouse shall contain the following information:

7-2E-1.1. Tax credit; rural job tax credit.  
A. The tax credit created by this section may be referred to as the "rural job tax credit".  Every eligible employer may apply for, and the taxation and revenue department may approve, a tax credit for each qualifying job the employer creates.  The maximum tax credit amount with respect to each qualifying job is equal to:  
(1) twenty-five percent of the first sixteen thousand dollars ($16,000) in wages paid for the qualifying job if the job is performed or based at a location in a tier one area; or 
(2) twelve and one-half percent of the first sixteen thousand dollars ($16,000) in wages paid if the qualifying job is performed or based at a location in a tier two area. 
B. The purpose of the rural job tax credit is to encourage businesses to start new businesses or expand existing businesses in rural areas of the state. 
C. The amount of the rural job tax credit shall be six and one-fourth percent of the first sixteen thousand dollars ($16,000) in wages paid for the qualifying job in a qualifying period.  The rural job tax credit may be claimed for each qualifying job for a maximum of: 
(1) four qualifying periods for each qualifying job performed or based at a location in a tier one area; and 
(2) two qualifying periods for each qualifying job performed or based at a location in a tier two area. 
D. With respect to each qualifying job for which an eligible employer seeks the rural job tax credit, the employer shall certify: 
(1) the amount of wages paid to each eligible employee during each qualifying period; 
(2) the number of weeks during the qualifying period the position was occupied;  
(3) whether the qualifying job was in a tier one or tier two area; 
(4) whether the application pertains to the first, second, third or fourth qualifying period, depending on whether the taxpayer is in a tier one or tier two area; 
(5) the total number of employees employed by the employer at the job location on the day prior to the qualifying period and on the last day of the qualifying period; 
(6) whether the eligible employer is receiving or is eligible to receive development training program assistance pursuant to Section 21-19-7 NMSA 1978; and 
(7) whether the eligible employer has ceased business operations at any of its business locations in New Mexico. 
E. The economic development department shall determine which employers are eligible employers and shall report the listing of eligible businesses to the taxation and revenue department in a manner and at times the departments shall agree upon. 
F. To receive a rural job tax credit with respect to any qualifying period, an eligible employer shall apply to the taxation and revenue department once per calendar year on forms and in the manner the department may prescribe.  The annual application shall include a certification made pursuant to Subsection D of this section and contain all qualifying periods that closed during the calendar year for which the application is made.  Any qualifying period that did not close in the calendar year for which the application is made shall be denied by the department.  The application for a calendar year shall be filed no later than December 31 of the following calendar year.  If a taxpayer fails to file the annual application within the time limits provided in this section, the department shall deny the application.  If all the requirements of this section have been complied with, the taxation and revenue department shall issue to the applicant a document granting a tax credit for the appropriate qualifying period.  The tax credit document shall be numbered for identification and declare its date of issuance and the amount of rural job tax credit allowed for the respective jobs created.  The tax credit documents may be sold, exchanged or otherwise transferred and may be carried forward for a period of three years from the date of issuance.  The parties to such a transaction to sell, exchange or transfer a rural job tax credit document shall notify the department of the transaction within ten days of the sale, exchange or transfer. 
G. The holder of the tax credit document may claim all or a portion of the rural job tax credit granted by the document against the holder's modified combined tax liability, personal income tax liability or corporate income tax liability.  Any balance of rural job tax credit granted by the document may be carried forward for up to three years from the date of issuance of the tax credit document.  No amount of rural job tax credit may be applied against a gross receipts tax or compensating tax imposed by a municipality or county. 
H. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 7-1-8 NMSA 1978, the taxation and revenue department may disclose to any person the balance of rural job tax credit remaining on any tax credit document and the balance of credit remaining on that document for any period. 
I. The secretary of economic development, the secretary of taxation and revenue and the secretary of workforce solutions or their designees shall annually evaluate the effectiveness of the rural job tax credit in stimulating economic development in the rural areas of New Mexico and make a joint report of their findings to each session of the legislature so long as the rural job tax credit is in effect. 
J. A qualifying job shall not be eligible for a rural job tax credit pursuant to this section if: 
(1) the job is created due to a business merger, acquisition or other change in organization; 
(2) the eligible employee was terminated from employment in New Mexico by another employer involved in the merger, acquisition or other change in organization; or 
(3) the job is performed by: 
(a) the person who performed the job or its functional equivalent prior to the business merger, acquisition or other change in organization; or 
(b) a person replacing the person who performed the job or its functional equivalent prior to the business merger, acquisition or other change in organization. 
K. Notwithstanding Subsection J of this section, a qualifying job that was created by another employer and for which the rural job tax credit application was received by the taxation and revenue department prior to July 1, 2013 and is under review or has been approved shall remain eligible for the rural job tax credit for the balance of the qualifying periods for which the job qualifies by the new employer that results from a business merger, acquisition or other change in the organization. 
L. A job shall not be eligible for a rural job tax credit pursuant to this section if the job is created due to an eligible employer entering into a contract or becoming a subcontractor to a contract with a governmental entity that replaces one or more entities performing functionally equivalent services for the governmental entity in New Mexico unless the job is a qualifying job that was not being performed by an employee of the replaced entity.

ARTICLE 2H  Native American Veterans' Income Tax Settlement Fund 
7-2H-1. Legislative findings. 
A. Native Americans have had a long history of serving their country through active duty in the armed forces of the United States during periods of both war and peace and have made great sacrifices in serving their country through active duty in the military during periods of war and peace.  
B. Native American veterans domiciled within the boundaries of their tribal lands or their spouse's tribal lands during their periods of active military service may have been exempt from paying state personal income taxes on their military income, but may have had state personal income taxes withheld from their military income.  
C. Native American veterans now are barred by the state statute of limitations from claiming refunds of state personal income taxes that may have been withheld from their military income when they were domiciled within the boundaries of their tribal lands or their spouse's tribal lands during the period of their active military duty, and even if not barred by the statute of limitations, the passage of time extending to decades will make it difficult for many Native American veterans to meet strict standards of proof that they are entitled to a refund of withheld state personal income taxes.  
D. It is incumbent upon the state to ensure that it was not unjustly enriched by the withholding of state personal income taxes from Native American veterans who were domiciled within the boundaries of their tribal lands or their spouse's tribal lands during the period of their active military duty, and the state should implement a feasible means of refunding to Native American veterans any state personal income taxes that were withheld from military income while they were domiciled within the boundaries of their tribal lands or their spouse's tribal lands during the period of their active military duty.

I. GENERAL CONSIDERATION. 
"Transactions and activity in the regular course of the taxpayer's trade or business" means business deals and the performance of a specific function in the normal, typical, customary or accustomed policy or procedure of the taxpayer's trade or business. Champion Int'l Corp. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-106, 88 N.M. 411, 540 P.2d 1300, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70; Tipperary Corp. v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1979-NMCA-031, 93 N.M. 22, 595 P.2d 1212, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 675, 593 P.2d 1078.  
II. CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES. 
Fairly apportioned tax constitutional. — When the apportioned tax is only on that portion of taxpayer's income that fairly represents the extent of taxpayer's business activities in this state, tax is not violative of the due process or commerce clauses of the 
federal constitution. Tipperary Corp. v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1979-NMCA-031, 93 N.M. 22, 595 P.2d 1212, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 675, 593 P.2d 1078.  
Taxation of dividends from foreign subsidiary. — The right of a state to tax dividends from foreign subsidiaries must be considered in relation to the due process requirements that the income attributed to a state for tax purposes be rationally related to values connected with the taxing state. F.W. Woolworth Co. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 458 U.S. 354, 102 S. Ct. 3128, 73 L. Ed. 2d 819, reh’g denied, 459 U.S. 961, 103 S. Ct. 274, 74 L. Ed. 2d 213 (1982).  
Taxation of income from foreign tax credit. — A foreign tax credit arising from the taxation by foreign nations of a corporation's foreign subsidiaries that had no unitary business relationship with the state, efforts by the state to tax this income "deemed received" - with respect to which the state contributed nothing - were held to contravene the due process clause. F.W. Woolworth Co. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 458 U.S. 354, 102 S. Ct. 3128, 73 L. Ed. 2d 819, reh’g denied, 459 U.S. 961, 103 S. Ct. 274, 74 L. Ed. 2d 213 (1982).  
III. BUSINESS INCOME. 
All income of business organization is not "business income"; business income must arise from the regular course of business. Tipperary Corp. v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1979-NMCA-031, 93 N.M. 22, 595 P.2d 1212, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 675, 593 P.2d 1078.  
Business income must arise from such transactions. — To constitute business income the income must arise from transactions and activity in the regular course of a trade or business. McVean & Barlow, Inc. v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-128, 88 N.M. 521, 543 P.2d 489, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 6, 546 P.2d 71.  
Factors pertinent in determining if income is business income. — Pertinent in determining whether income arises from transactions in the regular course of business is the nature of the particular transaction and former practices of the business entity; also pertinent is how the income is used. Champion Int'l Corp. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-106, 88 N.M. 411, 540 P.2d 1300, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70; Tipperary Corp. v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1979-NMCA-031, 93 N.M. 22, 595 P.2d 1212, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 675, 593 P.2d 1078.  
Use of investment income. — The use to which a multistate corporation put its investment income was determinative of whether it was business income. Champion Int'l Corp. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-106, 88 N.M. 411, 540 P.2d 1300, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70.  
Determination of business income. — Use to which income is put determines whether it is business income. Tipperary Corp. v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1979-NMCA-031, 93 N.M. 22, 595 P.2d 1212, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 675, 593 P.2d 1078.  
Short-term investment income held business income. — Since a multistate corporation derived interest income from capital earned in its business, rather than having a large cash balance in the bank, purchasing short-term investments and highly liquid assets from which the interest was derived, money from which short-term investments was needed for future business activity, such investment was a specific function of the corporation, and that it was usual and customary in the corporation's business to follow this practice, whenever there was enough money or business income that was not immediately needed in the business, and therefore the investment income was business income. Champion Int'l Corp. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-106, 88 N.M. 411, 540 P.2d 1300, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70.  
Rent of part of office space held business income. — Although a multistate corporate taxpayer claimed that income derived from rent of 5% of its total office space was not "business income" because it was not in the business of renting real estate, the most reasonable inference to be drawn from the record is that rental of available office space was a customary procedure, done in the regular course of the taxpayer's business, and since there was no evidence in the record to contradict this inference, the rental income was held to be "business income." Champion Int'l Corp. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-106, 88 N.M. 411, 540 P.2d 1300, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70.  
Income from sale of telephone poles by paper company held business income. — Since a multistate corporation manufactured wood and paper products from timber on land owned or leased by it, and sold some of its logs to telephone utilities for use as telephone poles and the sale of logs was a normal, customary procedure in the taxpayer's business for the year in question and had been for several years, the income arising therefrom was income arising from transactions and activity in the regular course of the taxpayer's trade or business. Champion Int'l Corp. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-106, 88 N.M. 411, 540 P.2d 1300, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70.  
When coal lease sale in regular course of business. — Since taxpayer is in the business of exploration and development of oil, gas and minerals, the sale of the coal leases is in the regular course of this business. Tipperary Corp. v. New Mexico Bureau of Revenue, 1979-NMCA-031, 93 N.M. 22, 595 P.2d 1212, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 675, 593 P.2d 1078.  
Coal lease sale taxable. — Since taxpayer's business is unitary and since a gain from the sale of its coal leases is business income under Subsection A of this section, this state can tax a percentage of this income. Tipperary Corp. v. New Mexico Bureau of Revenue, 1979-NMCA-031, 93 N.M. 22, 595 P.2d 1212, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 675, 593 P.2d 1078.  
Income from coal dragline leases held business income. — Oil company's income from its dragline leases was business income because the leases generated substantial capital for the company's general business purposes, and the leases were ongoing, recurring transactions constituting a regular or customary portion of company's overall 
business, which contributed to the company's economic enterprise as a whole. Kewanee Indus., Inc. v. Reese, 1993-NMSC-006, 114 N.M. 784, 845 P.2d 1238.  
Income from liquidation of part of business held not business income. — Since the taxpayer was not in the business of buying and selling pipeline equipment and the transaction in question was a partial liquidation of taxpayer's business and a total cessation and liquidation of one facet of the business, the sale of equipment did not constitute an integral part of the regular trade or business operations of taxpayer and the proceeds thereof were not business income. McVean & Barlow, Inc. v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-128, 88 N.M. 521, 543 P.2d 489, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 6, 546 P.2d 71.  
IV. UNITARY BUSINESS PRINCIPLE. 
Underlying unitary business required. — The linchpin of apportionability for state income taxation of an interstate enterprise is the unitary-business principle. F.W. Woolworth Co. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 458 U.S. 354, 102 S. Ct. 3128, 73 L. Ed. 2d 819, reh'g denied, 459 U.S. 961, 103 S. Ct. 274, 74 L. Ed. 2d 213 (1982).  
Derivation of dividend income from subsidiaries. — The potential to operate a company as part of a unitary business is not dispositive when, looking at the underlying economic realities of a unitary business, the dividend income from subsidiaries in fact is derived from unrelated business activity which constitutes a discrete business enterprise. F.W. Woolworth Co. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 458 U.S. 354, 102 S. Ct. 3128, 73 L. Ed. 2d 819, reh'g denied, 459 U.S. 961, 103 S. Ct. 274, 74 L. Ed. 2d 213 (1982).  
Existence of underlying unitary business. — When, except for the type of occasional oversight - with respect to capital structure, major debt, and dividends - that any parent gives to an investment in a subsidiary, there is little or no integration of business activities or centralization of management of the parent company and its foreign subsidiaries, there is no underlying unitary business that would justify the state's taxing of dividends from the foreign subsidiaries. F.W. Woolworth Co. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 458 U.S. 354, 102 S. Ct. 3128, 73 L. Ed. 2d 819, reh'g denied, 459 U.S. 961, 103 S. Ct. 274, 74 L. Ed. 2d 213 (1982).  
Multistate business may be unitary or independent. — A multistate business is a "unitary business" for income tax purposes when operations conducted in one state benefit and are in turn benefited by operations in another state, and if its various parts are interdependent and of mutual benefit so as to form one integral business rather than several business entities, it is unitary. On the other hand, if a multistate business enterprise is conducted in a way that one, some or all of the business operations outside New Mexico are independent of and do not contribute to the business operations within this state, the factors attributable to the outside activity may be excluded. Champion Int'l Corp. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-106, 88 N.M. 411, 540 P.2d 1300, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70.  
Taxpayer must show business independent to exclude income. — Where a multistate corporation challenged commissioner's allocation of certain interest, rent and gains to business income, but failed to produce evidence that its business activity outside of New Mexico was dependent or independent of its instate operations, or that the interest, rent and gains income was not an integral part of its business carried on in this state, no question was raised whether any of its income was nonbusiness income because there was no evidence that its activities were not part of a unitary business, and therefore the assessed additional corporate income tax was affirmed. Champion Int'l Corp. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-106, 88 N.M. 411, 540 P.2d 1300, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70.

B. that state has jurisdiction to subject the taxpayer to a net income tax, regardless of whether the state does or does not.

A. Except as provided in Subsections B and C of this section, all business income shall be apportioned to this state by multiplying the income by a fraction, the numerator 
of which is the property factor plus the payroll factor plus the sales factor and the denominator of which is three. 
B. If eighty percent or more of the New Mexico numerators of the property and payroll factors for a filing group, or for a taxpayer that is not a member of a filing group, are employed in manufacturing or operating a computer processing facility, the filing group or the taxpayer may elect to have business income apportioned to this state by multiplying the income by the sales factor for the taxable year.

Constitutionality of apportionment. — The United States Constitution does not impose any single method of apportionment on a multistate or multinational taxpayer's income. NCR Corp. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1993-NMCA-060, 115 N.M. 612, 856 P.2d 982, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 677, 857 P.2d 788, cert. denied, 512 U.S. 1245, 114 S. Ct. 2763, 129 L. Ed. 2d 877 (1994).  
Constitutionality of formula applied to taxation of dividends received from foreign subsidiaries. — Taxation of dividends from foreign subsidiaries under the separate corporate entity method violates the commerce clause of the United States Constitution, and application of the Detroit formula is an insufficient remedy. Conoco, Inc. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1997-NMSC-005, 122 N.M. 736, 931 P.2d 730, cert. denied, 521 U.S. 1112, 117 S. Ct. 2497, 138 L. Ed. 2d 1003 (1997), rev'g1997-NMCA-004, 122 N.M. 745, 931 P.2d 739.  
Standard for challenge of apportionment. — A taxpayer seeking to invalidate a state's apportionment formula must show by clear and cogent evidence that the income attributed to the state is in fact disproportionate to the business transacted in that state. NCR Corp. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1993-NMCA-060, 115 N.M. 612, 856 P.2d 982, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 677, 857 P.2d 788, cert. denied, 512 U.S. 1245, 114 S. Ct. 2763, 129 L. Ed. 2d 877 (1994).  
Apportionment of multinational income. — Under this statutory formula, the income attributable to the state is determined by multiplying the taxpayer's gross income by a fraction which represents the ratio of sales, payroll, and property located in the state to the total sales, payroll, and property of the corporation. This does not violate the Foreign Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution by taxing foreign income because the tax in question is not a tax on any of the domestic corporation's foreign subsidiaries; instead, 
the tax falls upon an apportioned share of the domestic corporation's income which it receives in the form of royalties, interest, and dividends from its unitary foreign subsidiaries. The fact that the tax is apportioned in part upon the domestic corporation's foreign income sources does not constitute a bar to state taxation. NCR Corp. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1993-NMCA-060, 115 N.M. 612, 856 P.2d 982, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 677, 857 P.2d 788, cert. denied, 512 U.S. 1245, 114 S. Ct. 2763, 129 L. Ed. 2d 877 (1994).  
Taxation of undistributed earnings. — Because its subsidiaries with Subpart F (26 U.S.C. § 952) income remain part of the parent's unitary business and the federal government requires inclusion of the parent's Subpart F income in gross income, under the unitary business principle, the state assessments in question here do not violate the United States or New Mexico Constitutions, are fairly apportioned, and tax a fair portion of such income even though some of the income is undistributed subsidiary earnings. NCR Corp. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1993-NMCA-060, 115 N.M. 612, 856 P.2d 982, cert. denied, 115 N.M. 677, 857 P.2d 788, cert. denied, 512 U.S. 1245, 114 S. Ct. 2763, 129 L. Ed. 2d 877 (1994). 
7-4-11. Property factor for apportionment of business income. 
The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the average value of the taxpayer's real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used in this state during the tax period and the denominator of which is the average value of all the taxpayer's real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used during the tax period.

Taxpayer's burden to show when modification of formula necessary. — Since there was nothing arbitrary or unreasonable about the department's conclusion that dividend income is apportionable without modification of the allocation and apportionment formula, the taxpayer bears the burden of showing by clear and cogent evidence that modification of the formula is necessary.

Taxpayer entitled to equitable apportionment. — Where taxpayer challenged the use of the department of taxation and revenue's (department) special multistate trucking apportionment regulation to calculate the portion of taxpayer's multistate sales revenue attributable to taxpayer's New Mexico business operations, and where the administrative hearing officer (AHO) found that taxpayer established by clear and cogent evidence that the department's use of the special mileage formula to determine New Mexico's share of taxpayer's multistate revenue for income tax purposes resulted in a gross distortion of taxpayer's actual business activities in New Mexico, contrary to the fair apportionment requirement of the United States constitution's commerce clause and New Mexico's Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act (UDIPTA), NMSA 1978, §§ 7-4-1 to 7-4-21, and that taxpayer was entitled to equitable apportionment and that the state-to-state volume method proposed by taxpayer was reasonable, and where 
the department appealed, claiming that the AHO erred as a matter of law in refusing to apply the department formula to taxpayer because its special mileage formula for apportioning the income of taxpayer for state corporate tax purposes has been found to be a constitutional method of apportioning the revenue of interstate carriers, the AHO did not err in departing from the department's method of apportionment, because NMSA 1978, § 7-4-19(D), provides that if the taxpayer carries its burden, the taxpayer may demand, or the department may require, the employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer's income, so long as the alternative method is reasonable, and the AHO's finding that taxpayer's state-to-state volume method was a reasonable method of allocating taxpayer's revenue was supported by substantial evidence in the record.

Any taxpayer having income from business activity that is taxable both within and without this state, other than activity as a financial organization or public utility or the rendering of purely personal services by an individual, shall allocate and apportion the taxpayer's net income as provided in this article.  If a taxpayer has income from business activity as a public utility but derives the greater percentage of the taxpayer's income from activities subject to this article, the taxpayer may elect to allocate and apportion the taxpayer's entire net income as provided in this article. 
3. For purposes of allocation and apportionment of income under this article, a taxpayer is taxable in another state if:  (1) in that state, the taxpayer is subject to a net income tax, a franchise tax measured by net income, a franchise tax for the privilege of doing business, or a corporate stock tax; or (2) that state has jurisdiction to subject the taxpayer to a net income tax regardless of whether, in fact, the state does or does not. 
4. Rents and royalties from real or tangible personal property, capital gains, interest, dividends or patent or copyright royalties, to the extent that they constitute nonbusiness income, shall be allocated as provided in Paragraphs 5 through 8 of this article. 
5. (a) Net rents and royalties from real property located in this state are allocable to this state. 
(b) Net rents and royalties from tangible personal property are allocable to this state:  (1) if and to the extent that the property is utilized in this state; or (2) in their entirety if the taxpayer's commercial domicile is in this state and the taxpayer is not organized under the laws of or taxable in the state in which the property is utilized. 
(c) The extent of utilization of tangible personal property in a state is determined by multiplying the rents and royalties by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days of physical location of the property in the state during the rental or royalty period in the taxable year and the denominator of which is the number of days of physical location of the property everywhere during all rental or royalty periods in the taxable year.  If the physical location of the property during the rental or royalty period is unknown or unascertainable by the taxpayer, tangible personal property is utilized in the state in which the property was located at the time the rental or royalty payer obtained possession. 
6. (a) Capital gains and losses from sales of real property located in this state are allocable to this state. 
(b) Capital gains and losses from sales of tangible personal property are allocable to this state if:  (1) the property had a situs in this state at the time of the sale; or (2) the taxpayer's commercial domicile is in this state and the taxpayer is not taxable in the state in which the property had a situs. 
(c) Capital gains and losses from sales of intangible personal property are allocable to this state if the taxpayer's commercial domicile is in this state. 
7. Interest and dividends are allocable to this state if the taxpayer's commercial domicile is in this state. 
8. (a) Patent and copyright royalties are allocable to this state:  (1) if and to the extent that the patent or copyright is utilized by the payer in this state; or (2) if and to the 
extent that the patent copyright is utilized by the payer in a state in which the taxpayer is not taxable and the taxpayer's commercial domicile is in this state. 
(b) A patent is utilized in a state to the extent that it is employed in production, fabrication, manufacturing, or other processing in the state or to the extent that a patented product is produced in the state.  If the basis of receipts from patent royalties does not permit allocation to states or if the accounting procedures do not reflect states of utilization, the patent is utilized in the state in which the taxpayer's commercial domicile is located. 
(c) A copyright is utilized in a state to the extent that printing or other publication originates in the state.  If the basis of receipts from copyright royalties does not permit allocation to states or if the accounting procedures do not reflect states of utilization, the copyright is utilized in the state in which the taxpayer's commercial domicile is located. 
9. All business income shall be apportioned to this state by multiplying the income by a fraction, the numerator of which is the property factor plus the payroll factor plus the sales factor, and the denominator of which is three. 
10. The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the average value of the taxpayer's real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used in this state during the tax period and the denominator of which is the average value of all the taxpayer's real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used during the tax period. 
11. Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its original cost.  Property rented by the taxpayer is valued at eight times the net annual rental rate.  Net annual rental rate is the annual rental rate paid by the taxpayer less any annual rental rate received by the taxpayer from subrentals. 
12. The average value of property shall be determined by averaging the values at the beginning and ending of the tax period but the tax administrator may require the averaging of monthly values during the tax period if reasonably required to reflect properly the average value of the taxpayer's property. 
13. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount paid in this state during the tax period by the taxpayer for compensation and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid everywhere during the tax period. 
14. Compensation is paid in this state if: 
(a) the individual's service is performed entirely within the state; 
(b) the individual's service is performed both within and without the state, but the service performed without the state is incidental to the individual's service within the state; or 
(c) some of the service is performed in the state and:  (1) the base of operations or, if there is no base of operations, the place from which the service is directed or controlled is in the state; or (2) the base of operations or the place from which the service is directed or controlled is not in any state in which some part of the service is performed, but the individual's residence is in this state. 
15. The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total sales of the taxpayer in this state during the tax period, and the denominator of which is the total sales of the taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. 
16. Sales of tangible personal property are in this state if: 
(a) the property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than the United States government, within this state regardless of the f.o.b. point or other conditions of the sale; or 
(b) the property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse, factory, or other place of storage in this state and:  (1) the purchaser is the United States government; or (2) the taxpayer is not taxable in the state of the purchaser. 
17. Sales, other than sales of tangible personal property, are in this state if: 
(a) the income-producing activity is performed in this state; or 
(b) the income-producing activity is performed both in and outside this state and a greater proportion of the income-producing activity is performed in this state than in any other state, based on costs of performance. 
18. If the allocation and apportionment provisions of this article do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer's business activity in this state, the taxpayer may petition for or the tax administrator may require, in respect to all or any part of the taxpayer's business activity, if reasonable: 
(a) separate accounting; 
(b) the exclusion of any one or more of the factors; 
(c) the inclusion of one or more additional factors which will fairly represent the taxpayer's business activity in this state; or 
(d) the employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer's income. 
Article V.  Elements of Sales and Use Tax Laws. 
Tax Credit. 
1. Each purchaser liable for a use tax on tangible personal property shall be entitled to full credit for the combined amount or amounts of legally imposed sales or use taxes paid by the purchaser with respect to the same property to another state and any subdivision thereof.  The credit shall be applied first against the amount of any use tax due the state, and any unused portion of the credit shall then be applied against the amount of any use tax due a subdivision. 
Exemption Certificates, Vendors May Rely. 
2. Whenever a vendor receives and accepts in good faith from a purchaser a resale or other exemption certificate or other written evidence of exemption authorized by the appropriate state or subdivision taxing authority, the vendor shall be relieved of liability for a sales or use tax with respect to the transaction. 
Article VI.  The Commission. 
Organization and Management. 
1. (a) The "multistate tax commission" is hereby established.  It shall be composed of one "member" from each party state who shall be the head of the state agency charged with the administration of the types of taxes to which this compact applies.  If there is more than one such agency the state shall provide by law for the selection of the commission member from the heads of the relevant agencies.  State law may provide that a member of the commission be represented by an alternate but only if there is on file with the commission written notification of the designation and identity of the alternate.  The attorney general of each party state or the attorney general's designee, or other counsel if the laws of the party state specifically provide, shall be entitled to attend the meetings of the commission, but shall not vote.  Such attorneys general, designees, or other counsel shall receive all notices of meetings required under Paragraph 1 (e) of this article. 
(b) Each party state shall provide by law for the selection of representatives from its subdivisions affected by this compact to consult with the commission member from that State. 
(c) Each member shall be entitled to one vote.  The commission shall not act unless a majority of the members are present, and no action shall be binding unless approved by a majority of the total number of members. 
(d) The commission shall adopt an official seal to be used as it may provide. 
(e) The commission shall hold an annual meeting and such other regular meetings as its bylaws may provide and such special meetings as its executive committee may determine.  The commission bylaws shall specify the dates of the annual and any other regular meetings, and shall provide for the giving of notice of annual, regular and special meetings.  Notices of special meetings shall include the reasons therefor and an agenda of the items to be considered. 
(f) The commission shall elect annually, from among its members, a chair, a vice chair and a treasurer.  The commission shall appoint an executive director who shall serve at its pleasure, and it shall fix the executive director's duties and compensation.  The executive director shall be secretary of the commission.  The commission shall make provision for the bonding of such of its officers and employees as it may deem appropriate. 
(g) Irrespective of the civil service, personnel or other merit system laws of any party state, the executive director shall appoint or discharge such personnel as may be necessary for the performance of the functions of the commission and shall fix their duties and compensation.  The commission bylaws shall provide for personnel policies and programs. 
(h) The commission may borrow, accept or contract for the services of personnel from any state, the United States, or any other governmental entity. 
(i) The commission may accept for any of its purposes and functions any and all donations and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials and services, conditional or otherwise, from any governmental entity, and may utilize and dispose of the same. 
(j) The commission may establish one or more offices for the transacting of its business. 
(k) The commission shall adopt bylaws for the conduct of its business.  The commission shall publish its bylaws in convenient form, and shall file a copy of the bylaws and any amendments thereto with the appropriate agency or officer in each of the party states. 
(l) The commission annually shall make to the governor and legislature of each party state a report covering its activities for the preceding year.  Any donation or grant accepted by the commission or services borrowed shall be reported in the annual report of the commission, and shall include the nature, amount and conditions, if any, of the donation, gift, grant or services borrowed and the identity of the donor or lender.  The commission may make additional reports as it may deem desirable. 
Committees. 
2. (a) To assist in the conduct of its business when the full commission is not meeting, the commission shall have an executive committee of seven members, including the chair, vice chair, treasurer and four other members elected annually by the commission.  The executive committee, subject to the provisions of this compact and consistent with the policies of the commission, shall function as provided in the bylaws of the commission. 
(b) The commission may establish advisory and technical committees, membership on which may include private persons and public officials, in furthering any of its activities.  Such committees may consider any matter of concern to the commission, including problems of special interest to any party state and problems dealing with particular types of taxes. 
(c) The commission may establish such additional committees as its bylaws may provide. 
Powers. 
3. In addition to powers conferred elsewhere in this compact, the commission shall have power to: 
(a) study state and local tax systems and particular types of state and local taxes; 
(b) develop and recommend proposals for an increase in uniformity or compatibility of state and local tax laws with a view toward encouraging the simplification and improvement of state and local tax law and administration; 
(c) compile and publish information as in its judgment would assist the party states in implementation of the compact and taxpayers in complying with state and local tax laws; and 
(d) do all things necessary and incidental to the administration of its functions pursuant to this compact. 
Finance. 
4. (a) The commission shall submit to the governor or designated officer or officers of each party state a budget of its estimated expenditures for such period as may be required by the laws of that state for presentation to the legislature thereof. 
(b) Each of the commission's budgets of estimated expenditures shall contain specific recommendations of the amounts to be appropriated by each of the party states.  The total amount of appropriations requested under any such budget shall be apportioned among the party states as follows:  one-tenth in equal shares; and the remainder in proportion to the amount of revenue collected by each party state and its 
subdivisions from income taxes, capital stock taxes, gross receipts taxes, sales and use taxes.  In determining such amounts, the commission shall employ such available public sources of information as, in its judgment, present the most equitable and accurate comparisons among the party states.  Each of the commission's budgets of estimated expenditures and requests for appropriations shall indicate the sources used in obtaining information employed in applying the formula contained in this paragraph. 
(c) The commission shall not pledge the credit of any party state.  The commission may meet any of its obligations in whole or in part with funds available to it under Paragraph (1) (i) of this article:  provided that the commission takes specific action setting aside such funds prior to incurring any obligation to be met in whole or in part in such manner.  Except where the commission makes use of funds available to it under Paragraph 1 (i) of this article, the commission shall not incur any obligation prior to the allotment of funds by the party states adequate to meet the same. 
(d) The commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements.  The receipts and disbursements of the commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws.  All receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the commission shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the commission. 
(e) The accounts of the commission shall be open at any reasonable time for inspection by duly constituted officers of the party states and by any persons authorized by the commission. 
(f) Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to prevent commission compliance with laws relating to audit or inspection of accounts by or on behalf of any government contributing to the support of the commission. 
Article VII.  Uniform Regulations and Forms. 
1. Whenever any two or more party states, or subdivisions of party states, have uniform or similar provisions of law relating to an income tax, capital stock tax, gross receipts tax, sales or use tax, the commission may adopt uniform regulations for any phase of the administration of such law, including assertion of jurisdiction to tax, or prescribing uniform tax forms.  The commission may also act with respect to the provisions of Article IV of this compact. 
2. Prior to the adoption of any regulation, the commission shall: 
(a) as provided in its bylaws, hold at least one public hearing on due notice to all affected party states and subdivisions thereof and to all taxpayers and other persons who have made timely request of the commission for advance notice of its regulation-making proceedings; and 
(b) afford all affected party states and subdivisions and interested persons an opportunity to submit relevant written data and views, which shall be considered fully by the commission. 
3. The commission shall submit any regulations adopted by it to the appropriate officials of all party states and subdivisions to which they might apply.  Each such state and subdivision shall consider any such regulation for adoption in accordance with its own laws and procedures. 
Article VIII.  Interstate Audits. 
1. This article shall be in force only in those party states that specifically provide therefor by statute. 
2. Any party state or subdivision thereof desiring to make or participate in an audit of any accounts, books, papers, records or other documents may request the commission to perform the audit on its behalf.  In responding to the request, the commission shall have access to and may examine, at any reasonable time, such accounts, books, papers, records, and other documents and any relevant property or stock of merchandise.  The commission may enter into agreements with party states or their subdivisions for assistance in performance of the audit.  The commission shall make charges, to be paid by the state or local government or governments for which it performs the service, for any audits performed by it in order to reimburse itself for the actual costs incurred in making the audit. 
3. The commission may require the attendance of any person within the state where it is conducting an audit or part thereof at a time and place fixed by it within such state for the purpose of giving testimony with respect to any account, book, paper, document, other record, property or stock of merchandise being examined in connection with the audit.  If the person is not within the jurisdiction, the person may be required to attend for such purpose at any time and place fixed by the commission within the state of which the person is a resident; provided that such state has adopted this article. 
4. The commission may apply to any court having power to issue compulsory process for orders in aid of its powers and responsibilities pursuant to this article and any and all such courts shall have jurisdiction to issue such orders.  Failure of any person to obey any such order shall be punishable as contempt of the issuing court.  If the party or subject matter on account of which the commission seeks an order is within the jurisdiction of the court to which application is made, such application may be to a court in the state or subdivision on behalf of which the audit is being made or a court in the state in which the object of the order being sought is situated.  The provisions of this paragraph apply only to courts in a state that has adopted this article. 
5. The commission may decline to perform any audit requested if it finds that its available personnel or other resources are insufficient for the purpose or that, in the terms requested, the audit is impracticable of satisfactory performance.  If the 
commission, on the basis of its experience, has reason to believe that an audit of a particular taxpayer, either at a particular time or on a particular schedule, would be of interest to a number of party states or their subdivisions, it may offer to make the audit or audits, the offer to be contingent on sufficient participation therein as determined by the commission. 
6. Information obtained by any audit pursuant to this article shall be confidential and available only for tax purposes to party states, their subdivisions or the United States.  Availability of information shall be in accordance with the laws of the states or subdivisions on whose account the commission performs the audit, and only through the appropriate agencies or officers of such states or subdivisions.  Nothing in this article shall be construed to require any taxpayer to keep records for any period not otherwise required by law. 
7. Other arrangements made or authorized pursuant to law for cooperative audit by or on behalf of the party states or any of their subdivisions are not superseded or invalidated by this article. 
8. In no event shall the commission make any charge against a taxpayer for an audit. 
9. As used in this article, "tax," in addition to the meaning ascribed to it in Article II of this compact, means any tax or license fee imposed in whole or in part for revenue purposes. 
Article IX.  Arbitration. 
1. Whenever the commission finds a need for settling disputes concerning apportionments and allocations by arbitration, it may adopt a regulation placing this article in effect, notwithstanding the provisions of Article VII of this compact. 
2. The commission shall select and maintain an arbitration panel composed of officers and employees of state and local governments and private persons who shall be knowledgeable and experienced in matters of tax law and administration. 
3. Whenever a taxpayer who has elected to employ Article IV of this compact, or whenever the laws of the party state or subdivision thereof are substantially identical with the relevant provisions of Article IV, the taxpayer, by written notice to the commission and to each party state or subdivision thereof that would be affected, may secure arbitration of an apportionment or allocation, if the taxpayer is dissatisfied with the final administrative determination of the tax agency of the state or subdivision with respect thereto on the ground that it would subject the taxpayer to double or multiple taxation by two or more party states or subdivisions thereof.  Each party state and subdivision thereof hereby consents to the arbitration as provided herein, and agrees to be bound thereby. 
4. The arbitration board shall be composed of one person selected by the taxpayer, one by the agency or agencies involved, and one member of the commission's arbitration panel.  If the agencies involved are unable to agree on the person to be selected by them, such person shall be selected by lot from the total membership of the arbitration panel. The two persons selected for the board in the manner provided by the foregoing provisions of this paragraph shall jointly select the third member of the board.  If they are unable to agree on the selection, the third member shall be selected by lot from among the total membership of the arbitration panel.  No member of a board selected by lot shall be qualified to serve if the member is an officer or employee or is otherwise affiliated with any party to the arbitration proceeding.  Residence within the jurisdiction of a party to the arbitration proceeding shall not constitute affiliation within the meaning of this paragraph. 
5. The board may sit in any state or subdivision party to the proceeding, in the state of the taxpayer's incorporation, residence or domicile, in any state where the taxpayer does business, or in any place that it finds most appropriate for gaining access to evidence relevant to the matter before it. 
6. The board shall give due notice of the times and places of its hearings.  The parties shall be entitled to be heard, to present evidence, and to examine and cross-examine witnesses.  The board shall act by majority vote. 
7. The board shall have power to administer oaths, take testimony, subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of accounts, books, papers, records, and other documents, and issue commissions to take testimony.  Subpoenas may be signed by any member of the board.  In case of failure to obey a subpoena, and upon application by the board, any judge of a court of competent jurisdiction of the state in which the board is sitting or in which the person to whom the subpoena is directed may be found may make an order requiring compliance with the subpoena, and the court may punish failure to obey the order as a contempt.  The provisions of this paragraph apply only in states that have adopted this article. 
8. Unless the parties otherwise agree the expenses and other costs of the arbitration shall be assessed and allocated among the parties by the board in such manner as it may determine.  The commission shall fix a schedule of compensation for members of arbitration boards and of other allowable expenses and costs.  No officer or employee of a state or local government who serves as a member of a board shall be entitled to compensation therefor unless the member is required on account of the member's service to forego the regular compensation attaching to the member's public employment, but any such board member shall be entitled to expenses. 
9. The board shall determine the disputed apportionment or allocation and any matters necessary thereto.  The determinations of the board shall be final for the purposes of making the apportionment or allocation, but for no other purpose. 
10. The board shall file with the commission and with each tax agency represented in the proceeding:  the determination of the board; the board's written statement of its reasons therefor; the record of the board's proceedings; and any other documents required by the arbitration rules of the commission to be filed. 
11. The commission shall publish the determinations of boards together with the statements of the reasons therefor. 
12. The commission shall adopt and publish rules of procedure and practice and shall file a copy of such rules and of any amendment thereto with the appropriate agency or officer in each of the party states. 
13. Nothing contained herein shall prevent at any time a written compromise of any matter or matters in dispute, if otherwise lawful, by the parties to the arbitration proceeding. 
Article X.  Entry Into Force and Withdrawal. 
1. This compact shall enter into force when enacted into law by any seven states.  Thereafter, this compact shall become effective as to any other state upon its enactment thereof.  The commission shall arrange for notification of all party states whenever there is a new enactment of the compact. 
2. Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same.  No withdrawal shall affect any liability already incurred by or chargeable to a party state prior to the time of such withdrawal. 
3. No proceeding commenced before an arbitration board prior to the withdrawal of a state and to which the withdrawing state or any subdivision thereof is a party shall be discontinued or terminated by the withdrawal, nor shall the board thereby lose jurisdiction over any of the parties to the proceeding necessary to make a binding determination therein. 
Article XI.  Effect on Other Laws and Jurisdiction. 
Nothing in this compact shall be construed to: 
(a) affect the power of any state or subdivision thereof to fix rates of taxation, except that a party state shall be obligated to implement Article III 1 of this compact; 
(b) apply to any tax or fixed fee imposed for the registration of a motor vehicle or any tax on motor fuel, other than a sales tax; provided that the definition of "tax" in Article VIII 9 of this compact may apply for the purposes of that article and the commission's powers of study and recommendation pursuant to Article VI 3 of this compact may apply; 
(c) withdraw or limit the jurisdiction of any state or local court or administrative officer or body with respect to any person, corporation or other entity or subject matter, except to the extent that such jurisdiction is expressly conferred by or pursuant to this compact upon another agency or body; and 
(d) supersede or limit the jurisdiction of any court of the United States. 
Article XII.  Construction and Severability. 
This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof.  The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.  If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any State participating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining party states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters."

7-5A-2. Legislative findings. 
The legislature finds that a simplified sales tax and use tax system that treats transactions in a competitively neutral manner will strengthen and preserve sales taxes and use taxes as vital revenue sources for this state and its local governments and will help preserve the fiscal sovereignty of this state. The legislature also finds that such a system will substantially reduce the administrative burdens of collection for sellers. While states have the sovereign right to set their own tax policies, states should cooperatively develop a streamlined sales tax and use tax system that is simplified, uniform and fair.

7-8A-2. Presumptions of abandonment. 
A. Property is presumed abandoned if it is unclaimed by the apparent owner during the time set forth below for the particular property:  
(1) traveler's check, fifteen years after issuance;  
(2) money order, seven years after issuance;  
(3) stock or other equity interest in a business association or financial organization, including a security entitlement under Article 8 [55-8-101 NMSA 1978] of the Uniform Commercial Code, five years after the earlier of:  
(a) the date of the most recent dividend, stock split or other distribution unclaimed by the apparent owner; or  
(b) the date of the second mailing of a statement of account or other notification or communication that was returned as undeliverable or after the holder discontinued mailings, notifications or communications to the apparent owner;  
(4) debt of a business association or financial organization, other than a bearer bond or an original issue discount bond, five years after the date of the most recent interest payment unclaimed by the apparent owner;  
(5) a demand, savings or time deposit, including a deposit that is automatically renewable, five years after the earlier of maturity or the date of the last indication by the owner of interest in the property; but a deposit that is automatically renewable is deemed matured for purposes of this section upon its initial date of maturity, unless the owner has consented to a renewal at or about the time of the renewal and the consent is in writing or is evidenced by a memorandum or other record on file with the holder;  
(6) money or credits owed to a customer as a result of a retail business transaction, three years after the obligation accrued;  
(7) gift certificate, five years after December 31 of the year in which the certificate was sold, but if redeemable in merchandise only, the amount abandoned is deemed to be sixty percent of the certificate's face value;  
(8) amount owed by an insurer on a life or endowment insurance policy or an annuity that has matured or terminated, three years after the obligation to pay arose or, in the case of a policy or annuity payable upon proof of death, three years after the insured has attained, or would have attained if living, the limiting age under the mortality table on which the reserve is based;  
(9) property distributable by a business association or financial organization in a course of dissolution, one year after the property becomes distributable;  
(10) property received by a court as proceeds of a class action and not distributed pursuant to the judgment, one year after the distribution date;  
(11) property held by a court, government, governmental subdivision, agency or instrumentality, one year after the property becomes distributable;  
(12) wages or other compensation for personal services, one year after the compensation becomes payable;  
(13) deposit or refund owed to a subscriber by a utility, one year after the deposit or refund becomes payable;  
(14) property in an individual retirement account, defined benefit plan or other account or plan that is qualified for tax deferral under the income tax laws of the United States, three years after the earliest of the date of the distribution or attempted distribution of the property, the date of the required distribution as stated in the plan or trust agreement governing the plan or the date, if determinable by the holder, specified in the income tax laws of the United States by which distribution of the property must begin in order to avoid a tax penalty; and  
(15) all other property, five years after the owner's right to demand the property or after the obligation to pay or distribute the property arises, whichever first occurs.  
B. At the time that an interest is presumed abandoned under Subsection A of this section, any other property right accrued or accruing to the owner as a result of the interest, and not previously presumed abandoned, is also presumed abandoned.  
C. Property is unclaimed if, for the applicable period set forth in Subsection A of this section, the apparent owner has not communicated in writing or by other means reflected in a contemporaneous record prepared by or on behalf of the holder, with the holder concerning the property or the account in which the property is held and has not otherwise indicated an interest in the property. A communication with an owner by a person other than the holder or its representative who has not in writing identified the property to the owner is not an indication of interest in the property by the owner.  
D. An indication of an owner's interest in property includes:  
(1) the presentment of a check or other instrument of payment of a dividend or other distribution made with respect to an account or underlying stock or other interest in a business association or financial organization or, in the case of a distribution made by electronic or similar means, evidence that the distribution has been received;  
(2) owner-directed activity in the account in which the property is held, including a direction by the owner to increase, decrease or change the amount or type of property held in the account;  
(3) the making of a deposit to or withdrawal from a bank account; and  
(4) the payment of a premium with respect to a property interest in an insurance policy; but the application of an automatic premium loan provision or other nonforfeiture provision contained in an insurance policy does not prevent a policy from maturing or terminating if the insured has died or the insured or the beneficiary of the policy has otherwise become entitled to the proceeds before the depletion of the cash surrender value of a policy by the application of those provisions.  
E. Property is payable or distributable for purposes of the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995) notwithstanding the owner's failure to make demand or present an instrument or document otherwise required to obtain payment.

7-8A-6. Burden of proof as to property evidenced by record of check or draft. 
A record of the issuance of a check, draft or similar instrument is prima facie evidence of an obligation. In claiming property from a holder who is also the issuer, the administrator's burden of proof as to the existence and amount of the property and its abandonment is satisfied by showing issuance of the instrument and passage of the requisite period of abandonment. Defenses of payment, satisfaction, discharge and want of consideration are affirmative defenses that must be established by the holder.

C. If a holder of property presumed abandoned is a successor to another person who previously held the property for the apparent owner or the holder has changed its name while holding the property, the holder shall file with the report its former names, if any, and the known names and addresses of all previous holders of the property.

If a holder does not report an address for the apparent owner or the address is outside this state, the notice must be published in the county in which the holder has its principal place of business within this state or another county that the administrator reasonably selects", and after "attention of the", deleted "apparent owner of the unclaimed property" and added "general public"; in Subsection A after "the", deleted "name of each person appearing to be the owner of the property, as set forth in the report filed by the holder" and added "website on which to search for information about abandoned properties"; in Subsection B, after "the", deleted "last known address or

7-8A-10. Custody by state; recovery by holder; defense of holder. 
(a) In this section, payment or delivery is made in "good faith" if:  
(1) payment or delivery was made in a reasonable attempt to comply with the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995);  
(2) the holder was not then in breach of a fiduciary obligation with respect to the property and had a reasonable basis for believing, based on the facts then known, that the property was presumed abandoned; and  
(3) there is no showing that the records under which the payment or delivery was made did not meet reasonable commercial standards of practice.  
(b) Upon payment or delivery of property to the administrator, the state assumes custody and responsibility for the safekeeping of the property. A holder who pays or delivers property to the administrator in good faith is relieved of all liability arising thereafter with respect to the property.  
(c) A holder who has paid money to the administrator pursuant to the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995) may subsequently make payment to a person reasonably appearing to the holder to be entitled to payment. Upon a filing by the holder of proof of payment and proof that the payee was entitled to the payment, the administrator shall promptly reimburse the holder for the payment without imposing a fee or other charge. If reimbursement is sought for a payment made on a negotiable instrument, including a traveler's check or money order, the holder must be reimbursed upon filing proof that the instrument was duly presented and that payment was made to a person who reasonably appeared to be entitled to payment. The holder must be reimbursed for payment made even if the payment was made to a person whose claim was barred under Section 19(a) [7-8A-19(a) NMSA 1978] of the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995).  
(d) A holder who has delivered property other than money to the administrator pursuant to the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995) may reclaim the property if it is still in the possession of the administrator, without paying any fee or other charge, upon filing proof that the apparent owner has claimed the property from the holder.  
(e) The administrator may accept a holder's affidavit as sufficient proof of the holder's right to recover money and property under this section.  
(f) If a holder pays or delivers property to the administrator in good faith and thereafter another person claims the property from the holder or another state claims the money or property under its laws relating to escheat or abandoned or unclaimed property, the administrator, upon written notice of the claim, shall defend the holder against the claim and indemnify the holder against any liability on the claim resulting from payment or delivery of the property to the administrator.  
(g) Property removed from a safe deposit box or other safekeeping depository is received by the administrator subject to the holder's right to be reimbursed for the cost of the opening and to any valid lien or contract providing for the holder to be reimbursed for unpaid rent or storage charges. The administrator shall reimburse the holder out of the proceeds remaining after deducting the expense incurred by the administrator in selling the property.

If property other than money is delivered to the administrator under the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995), the owner is entitled to receive from the administrator any income or gain realized or accruing on the property at or before liquidation or conversion of the property into money. If the property was an interest-bearing demand, savings, or time deposit, including a deposit that is automatically renewable, the administrator shall pay interest at a rate of five percent a year or any lesser rate the property earned while in the possession of the holder. Interest begins to accrue when the property is delivered to the administrator and ceases on the earlier of the expiration of ten years after delivery or the date on which payment is made to the owner.

A. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the administrator, within three years after the receipt of abandoned property, shall sell it to the highest bidder at public sale at a location in this state or by any reasonable method, which in the judgment of the administrator affords the most favorable market for the property. The administrator may decline the highest bid and re-offer the property for sale if the administrator considers the bid to be insufficient. The administrator need not offer the property for sale if the administrator considers that the probable cost of sale will exceed the proceeds of the sale. A sale held under this section must be preceded by a single publication of notice, at least three weeks before sale, in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the property is to be sold.  
B. Securities listed on an established stock exchange must be sold at prices prevailing on the exchange at the time of sale. Other securities may be sold over the counter at prices prevailing at the time of sale or by any reasonable method selected by the administrator. If securities are sold by the administrator before the expiration of three years after their delivery to the administrator, a person making a claim under the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995) before the end of the three-year period is entitled to the proceeds of the sale of the securities or the market value of the securities at the time the claim is made, whichever is greater, plus dividends, interest and other increments thereon up to the time the claim is made, less any deduction for expenses of sale. A person making a claim under the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995) after the expiration of the three-year period is entitled to receive the securities delivered to the administrator by the holder, if they still remain in the custody of the administrator, or the net proceeds received from sale and is not entitled to receive any appreciation in the value of the property occurring after delivery to the administrator except in a case of intentional misconduct or malfeasance by the administrator.  
C. A purchaser of property at a sale conducted by the administrator pursuant to the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995) takes the property free of all claims of the owner or previous holder and of all persons claiming through or under them. The administrator shall execute all documents necessary to complete the transfer of ownership.

7-8A-14. Claim of another state to recover property. 
(a) After property has been paid or delivered to the administrator under the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995), another state may recover the property if:  
(1) the property was paid or delivered to the custody of this state because the records of the holder did not reflect a last known location of the apparent owner within the borders of the other state and the other state establishes that the apparent owner or other person entitled to the property was last known to be located within the borders of that state and under the laws of that state the property has escheated or become subject to a claim of abandonment by that state;  
(2) the property was paid or delivered to the custody of this state because the laws of the other state did not provide for the escheat or custodial taking of the property, and under the laws of that state subsequently enacted the property has escheated or become subject to a claim of abandonment by that state;  
(3) the records of the holder were erroneous in that they did not accurately identify the owner of the property and the last known location of the owner within the borders of another state and under the laws of that state the property has escheated or become subject to a claim of abandonment by that state;  
(4) the property was subjected to custody by this state under Section 4(6) [7-8A-4(6) NMSA 1978] of the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995), and under the laws of the state of domicile of the holder the property has escheated or become subject to a claim of abandonment by that state; or  
(5) the property is a sum payable on a traveler's check, money order or similar instrument that was purchased in the other state and delivered into the custody of this state under Section 4(7) [7-8A-4(7) NMSA 1978] of the Uniform Unclaimed 
Property Act (1995), and under the laws of the other state the property has escheated or become subject to a claim of abandonment by that state.  
(b) A claim of another state to recover escheated or abandoned property must be presented in a form prescribed by the administrator, who shall decide the claim within ninety days after it is presented. The administrator shall allow the claim upon determining that the other state is entitled to the abandoned property under Subsection (a) of this section.  
(c) The administrator shall require another state, before recovering property under this section, to agree to indemnify this state and its officers and employees against any liability on a claim to the property.

(a) A person, excluding another state, claiming property paid or delivered to the administrator may file a claim on a form prescribed by the administrator and verified by the claimant.  
(b) Within ninety days after a claim is filed, the administrator shall allow or deny the claim and give written notice of the decision to the claimant. If the claim is denied, the administrator shall inform the claimant of the reasons for the denial and specify what additional evidence is required before the claim will be allowed. The claimant may then file a new claim with the administrator or maintain an action under Section 16 of the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995).  
(c) Within thirty days after a claim is allowed, the property or the net proceeds of a sale of the property must be delivered or paid by the administrator to the claimant, together with any dividend, interest or other increment to which the claimant is entitled under Sections 11 and 12 [7-8A-11 and 7-8A-12 NMSA 1978] of the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995).

The Unclaimed Property Act’s administrative process is exclusive and mandatory. — Where petitioner was appointed the personal representative of his deceased grandfather’s estate, and where the probate court, at petitioner’s request, issued an order directing the New Mexico taxation and revenue department (department) to release $70,000 of unclaimed property that belonged to decedent, and where the probate court transferred the case to the district court when the department refused to release the property, the district court’s order directing the department to comply with the probate court and release the unclaimed property to petitioner was invalid, because the administrative claim filing provisions of the Unclaimed Property Act, 7-8A-1 to 7-8A-31 NMSA 1978, are exclusive and mandatory, and therefore the district court did not have jurisdiction to determine that the property was estate property or to enforce the probate court’s order as the probate court had no authority to order the department to release the unclaimed property to petitioner. In re Estate of McElveny, 2017-NMSC-024, rev’g 2015-NMCA-080, 355 P.3d 75.  
The Uniform Unclaimed Property Act is not the exclusive mode for disbursing unclaimed property. — There is no intent expressed by the legislature that the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act supersedes the Uniform Probate Code; therefore, the district court’s general civil jurisdiction in formal probate proceedings gave the district court jurisdiction to order the taxation and revenue department to release unclaimed property of decedent to petitioner, as personal representative of decedent’s estate, notwithstanding the procedures set forth in this section for acquiring unclaimed property.

7-8A-16. Appeal; action to establish claim. 
A. A person aggrieved by a decision of the administrator may file an appeal pursuant to the provisions of Section 39-3-1.1 NMSA 1978.  
B. A person whose claim has not been acted upon within ninety days after its filing may maintain an original action to establish the claim in the district court for the first judicial district, naming the administrator as a defendant.  
C. If the aggrieved person establishes the claim in an action against the administrator, the court may award the claimant reasonable attorney fees.

Administrative remedies must be exhausted prior to seeking court relief. — Where petitioner was appointed the personal representative of his deceased grandfather’s estate, and where the probate court, at petitioner’s request, issued an order directing the New Mexico taxation and revenue department (department) to release $70,000 of unclaimed property that belonged to decedent, and where the probate court transferred the case to the district court when the department refused to release the property, petitioner erroneously sought relief from the district court before exhausting his administrative remedies under the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (act), 7-8A-1 to 7-8A-31 NMSA 1978, because under the act, it is clear that the legislature intended the department to decide unclaimed property matters prior to parties seeking relief in the courts.

(a) The administrator may decline to receive property reported under the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995) which the administrator considers to have a value less than the expenses of notice and sale.  
(b) A holder, with the written consent of the administrator and upon conditions and terms prescribed by the administrator, may report and deliver property before the property is presumed abandoned. Property so delivered must be held by the administrator and is not presumed abandoned until it otherwise would be presumed abandoned under the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995).

(a) The expiration, before or after the effective date of the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995), of a period of limitation on the owner's right to receive or recover property, whether specified by contract, statute or court order, does not preclude the property from being presumed abandoned or affect a duty to file a report or to pay or deliver or transfer property to the administrator as required by the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995).  
(b) An action or proceeding may not be maintained by the administrator to enforce the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995) in regard to the reporting, delivery, or payment of property more than ten years after the holder specifically identified the property in a report filed with the administrator or gave express notice to the administrator of a dispute regarding the property. In the absence of such a report or other express notice, the period of limitation is tolled. The period of limitation is also tolled by the filing of a report that is fraudulent.

7-8A-20. Requests for reports and examination of records. 
(a) The administrator may require a person who has not filed a report, or a person whom the administrator believes has filed an inaccurate, incomplete or false report, to 
file a verified report in a form specified by the administrator. The report must state whether the person is holding property reportable under the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995), describe property not previously reported or as to which the administrator has made inquiry, and specifically identify and state the amounts of property that may be in issue.  
(b) The administrator, at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice, may examine the records of any person to determine whether the person has complied with the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995). The administrator may conduct the examination even if the person believes it is not in possession of any property that must be reported, paid or delivered under the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995). The administrator may contract with any other person to conduct the examination on behalf of the administrator.  
(c) The administrator at reasonable times may examine the records of an agent, including a dividend disbursing agent or transfer agent, of a business association or financial association that is the holder of property presumed abandoned if the administrator has given the notice required by Subsection (b) of this section to both the association or organization and the agent at least ninety days before the examination.  
(d) Documents and working papers obtained or compiled by the administrator, or the administrator's agents, employees or designated representatives, in the course of conducting an examination are confidential and are not public records, but the documents and papers may be:  
(1) used by the administrator in the course of an action to collect unclaimed property or otherwise enforce the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995);  
(2) used in joint examinations conducted with or pursuant to an agreement with another state, the federal government, or any other governmental subdivision, agency or instrumentality;  
(3) produced pursuant to subpoena or court order; or  
(4) disclosed to the abandoned property office of another state for that state's use in circumstances equivalent to those described in this subsection, if the other state is bound to keep the documents and papers confidential.  
(e) If an examination of the records of a person results in the disclosure of property reportable under the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995), the administrator may assess the cost of the examination against the holder at the rate of two hundred dollars ($200) a day for each examiner, or a greater amount that is reasonable and was incurred, but the assessment may not exceed the value of the property found to be reportable. The cost of an examination made pursuant to Subsection (c) of this section may be assessed only against the business association or financial organization.  
(f) If, after the effective date of the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995), a holder does not maintain the records required by Section 21 [7-8A-21 NMSA 1978] of that act and the records of the holder available for the periods subject to that act are insufficient to permit the preparation of a report, the administrator may require the holder to report and pay to the administrator the amount the administrator reasonably estimates, on the basis of any available records of the holder or by any other reasonable method of estimation, should have been but was not reported.

7-8A-23. Interstate agreements and cooperation; joint and reciprocal actions with other states. 
(a) The administrator may enter into an agreement with another state to exchange information relating to abandoned property or its possible existence. The agreement may permit the other state, or another person acting on behalf of a state, to examine records as authorized in Section 20 [7-8A-20 NMSA 1978] of the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995). The administrator by rule may require the reporting of information needed to enable compliance with an agreement made under this section and prescribe the form.  
(b) The administrator may join with another state to seek enforcement of the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995) against any person who is or may be holding property reportable under that act.  
(c) At the request of another state, the attorney general of this state may maintain an action on behalf of the other state to enforce, in this state, the unclaimed property laws of the other state against a holder of property subject to escheat or a claim of abandonment by the other state, if the other state has agreed to pay expenses incurred by the attorney general in maintaining the action.  
(d) The administrator may request that the attorney general of another state or another attorney commence an action in the other state on behalf of the administrator. With the approval of the attorney general of this state, the administrator may retain any other attorney to commence an action in this state on behalf of the administrator. This state shall pay all expenses, including attorney's fees, in maintaining an action under this subsection. With the administrator's approval, the expenses and attorney's fees may be paid from money received under the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995). The administrator may agree to pay expenses and attorney's fees based in whole or in part on a percentage of the value of any property recovered in the action. Any expenses or attorney's fees paid under this subsection may not be deducted from the amount that is subject to the claim by the owner under the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995).

(b) Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (c) of this section, a holder who fails to report, pay or deliver property within the time prescribed by the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995), or fails to perform other duties imposed by that act, shall pay to the administrator, in addition to interest as provided in Subsection (a) of this section, a civil penalty of one hundred dollars ($100) for each day the report, payment or delivery is withheld, or the duty is not performed, up to a maximum of five thousand dollars ($5,000).

7-8A-25. Agreement to locate property. 
A. An agreement by an owner, the primary purpose of which is to locate, deliver, recover or assist in the recovery of property that is presumed abandoned, is void and unenforceable if it was entered into during the period commencing on the date the property was presumed abandoned and extending to a time that is forty-eight months after the date the property is paid or delivered to the administrator. This subsection does not apply to an owner's agreement with an attorney to file a claim as to identified property or contest the administrator's denial of a claim.  
B. An agreement by an owner, the primary purpose of which is to locate, deliver, recover or assist in the recovery of property, is enforceable only if the agreement is in writing, clearly sets forth the nature of the property and the services to be rendered, is signed by the apparent owner and states the value of the property before and after the fee or other compensation has been deducted.  
C. If an agreement covered by this section applies to mineral proceeds and the agreement contains a provision to pay compensation that includes a portion of the underlying minerals or any mineral proceeds not then presumed abandoned, the provision is void and unenforceable.  
D. An agreement covered by this section which provides for compensation that is unconscionable is unenforceable except by the owner. An owner who has agreed to pay compensation that is unconscionable or the administrator on behalf of the owner may maintain an action to reduce the compensation to a conscionable amount. The court may award reasonable attorney fees to an owner who prevails in the action.  
E. This section does not preclude an owner from asserting that an agreement covered by this section is invalid on grounds other than unconscionable compensation.

(3) patronage capital or other tangible ownership interest in a rural electric cooperative, a telephone cooperative, a water cooperative or an agricultural cooperative, if the bylaws of the cooperative provide for unclaimed patronage capital to be used for educational scholarships or other charitable uses.

(a) An initial report filed under the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995) for property that was not required to be reported before the effective date of that act, but which is subject to that act, must include all items of property that would have been presumed abandoned during the ten-year period next preceding the effective date of the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995) as if that act had been in effect during that period.  
(b) The Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995) does not relieve a holder of a duty that arose before the effective date of that act to report, pay or deliver property. Except as otherwise provided in Section 19(b) [7-8A-19(b) NMSA 1978] of the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (1995), a holder who did not comply with the law in effect before the effective date of that act is subject to the applicable provisions for enforcement and penalties which then existed, which are continued in effect for the purpose of this section.

Contracts of sale or service subject to gross receipts tax. — Taxable incidents are equally apparent and are ascertainable with equal ease whether they arise out of a contract of sale or out of a contract for services, and therefore, equally subject to the New Mexico gross receipts tax. Evco v. Jones, 1971-NMCA-123, 83 N.M. 110, 488 P.2d 1214, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 105, 488 P.2d 1209, rev'd on other grounds, 409 U.S. 91, 93 S. Ct. 349, 34 L. Ed. 2d 325 (1972) (decided under prior law).  
Purchasers of property for lease but not lessees subject to gross receipts tax. — Neither the gross receipts tax nor the compensating tax is payable under the law applicable to this appeal by one who leased property for sublease in this state. Such tax, however, is payable by one who has purchased property for lease in this state, thus the legislature has made a distinction with respect to tax liability as between purchasers and lessees. Rust Tractor Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1970-NMCA-107, 82 N.M. 82, 475 P.2d 779, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 81, 475 P.2d 778.  
Gross receipts tax but not use tax applicable to Indians. — The exemption in § 5 of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 (25 U.S.C. § 465) does not encompass or bar the collection of the state's nondiscriminatory gross receipts tax pursuant to 72-16-1, 1953 Comp. (since repealed). Therefore, a tribal ski enterprise conducted by the tribe with federal funds, on federal lands leased to them, was subject to that tax. However, a compensating or use tax, 72-17-1, 1953 Comp. (since repealed), imposed on personalty 
installed in ski lift construction was improper under § 5. Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, 411 U.S. 145, 93 S. Ct. 1267, 36 L. Ed. 2d 114 (1973) (decided under former Section 72-17-1, 1953 Comp.).  
Indian trader statutes. — The Indian trader statutes (25 U.S.C. §§ 261 to 264) preempt the imposition of gross receipts tax of this Article on receipts for non-Indian services rendered to an Indian tribal entity on the reservation. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't v. Laguna Indus., Inc., 1993-NMSC-025, 115 N.M. 553, 855 P.2d 127.  
Lessee's activity on tax-exempt Indian land subject to gross receipts tax. Norvell v. Sangre de Cristo Dev. Co., 372 F. Supp. 348 (D.N.M. 1974), rev'd on other grounds, 519 F.2d 370 (10th Cir. 1975).  
Burden on taxpayer to show rate erroneous. — When government contractor appeals the assessment of a gross receipts tax, penalty and interest, he has the burden of showing the assessment at a higher tax rate established by the 1969 Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax Act rather than a lower rate under a pre-1969 tax act was erroneous. Martinez v. Jones, 1972-NMCA-054, 83 N.M. 722, 497 P.2d 233, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 741, 497 P.2d 743.  
Regulation attacked only if taxpayer's contract properly subject thereunder. — When party, in addition to appealing the assessment of a gross receipts tax, penalty and interest, is attacking validity of regulation governing registration of contracts for purpose of determining gross receipts and compensating tax rate, and party neither offers in evidence his contract with the state highway department, nor does he prove the essential provisions of the contract, the question of the validity of the system of registration is premature until it is shown that the contract could be properly registered under the regulation. Martinez v. Jones, 1972-NMCA-054, 83 N.M. 722, 497 P.2d 233, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 741, 497 P.2d 743.  
Electrical energy tax invalid. — Because 7-9-80 NMSA 1978 (since repealed) insured that locally consumed electricity is subject to no tax burden from the electrical energy tax, while electricity generated in this state but sold outside the state is subject to a 2% tax, the tax itself indirectly but necessarily discriminates against electricity sold outside New Mexico; it thus violates a federal statute, 15 U.S.C. § 391, and is invalid under the supremacy clause of the United States constitution. Arizona Pub. Serv. Co. v. Snead, 441 U.S. 141, 99 S. Ct. 1629, 60 L. Ed. 2d 106 (1979).  
Federal statute invalidating energy tax constitutional. — A federal statute, 15 U.S.C. § 391, which invalidates the New Mexico electric energy tax, does not exceed the permissible bounds of congressional action under the commerce clause of the United States constitution since congress had a rational basis for finding that the tax interfered with interstate commerce and selected a reasonable method to eliminate that interference. Arizona Pub. Serv. Co. v. Snead, 441 U.S. 141, 99 S. Ct. 1629, 60 L. Ed. 2d 106 (1979).  
Tax exemptions and deductions not unconstitutional donations unless retroactive. — Gross receipts tax exemptions and deductions do not violate the antidonation clause of the N.M. Const., art. IX, § 14 unless they are applied retroactively to taxes due and payable. 1991 Op. Att'y Gen. No. 91-14.

Gross receipts tax and compensating tax not double taxation. — Since the gross receipts tax and compensating tax were not imposed upon a single transaction, as appellant contended, but upon different taxable incidents; namely, (1) the use of property in this state, such use being leasing or renting it to others (compensating or use tax) and (2) the receipts derived from the payment of rental by those to whom the property was leased (gross receipts or sales tax), then imposition of both taxes did not constitute double taxation on an identical transaction and was not prohibited. Rust Tractor Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1970-NMCA-107, 82 N.M. 82, 475 P.2d 779, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 81, 475 P.2d 778.  
Exemption from gross receipts tax also exemption from compensating tax. — The legislature intended to make the gross receipts tax and compensating tax correlate: an exemption from the gross receipts tax must also be treated as an exemption from the compensating tax. Western Elec. Co. v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1976-NMCA-047, 90 N.M. 164, 561 P.2d 26.  
Receipts from horse races not exempt. — The legislature, in enacting the Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax Act, did not intend to exempt receipts from horse races. There is neither ambiguity nor doubt that the language used in the Gross Receipts Tax Act applies to the receipts of a horse owner paid to him for a winning purse and the receipts of a horse trainer paid to him as his percentage of a winning purse. Till v. Jones, 1972-NMCA-046, 83 N.M. 743, 497 P.2d 745, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 740, 497 P.2d 742. See Section 7-9-40 NMSA 1978, which now exempts receipts from horse race purses.  
Deductions strictly construed against taxpayer. — The avowed purpose of the Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax Act is to provide revenue, and any deductions must receive strict construction in favor of the taxing authority. Reed v. Jones, 1970-NMCA-050, 81 N.M. 481, 468 P.2d 882.  
Burden on taxpayer to establish deduction. — The burden is on the taxpayer to establish clearly his right to the deduction, and the intention to authorize the deduction claimed by the taxpayer must be clearly and unambiguously expressed in the statute. Reed v. Jones, 1970-NMCA-050, 81 N.M. 481, 468 P.2d 882.  
Implied rational basis. — Because regulations exempted broadcasting advertisement displayers in New Mexico from the tax imposed upon taxpayer (operator of a billboard service), there was discrimination in the treatment of these different media forms, but the burden was upon the taxpayer to negative every conceivable basis which might support the discriminatory classification, because of the implied rational basis underlying every tax statute, i.e., that the state has the right, power and duty to raise the necessary funds for its public purposes, and it was held that there was a rational basis for the state to discriminate between the broadcast industry and the outdoor advertising industry in the taxation of displays of national messages. Markham Adver. Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-071, 88 N.M. 176, 538 P.2d 1198, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 318, 540 P.2d 248.

Language of this section is definite and unambiguous. Miller v. Bureau of Revenue, 1979-NMCA-005, 93 N.M. 252, 599 P.2d 1049, cert. denied, 92 N.M. 532, 591 P.2d 286.  
Taxpayer should be given fair, unbiased and reasonable construction, without favor either to the taxpayer or the state, to the end that the legislative intent is effectuated and the public interests to be subserved thereby furthered. Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream Co. v. Revenue Div., 1979-NMCA-098, 93 N.M. 301, 599 P.2d 1098.  
Taxes assessed only on receipts or future receipts. — A reading of the full act providing for gross receipts tax shows the legislative intent to be that taxes were to be assessed only on what was received or would be received. Davis v. Commissioner of Revenue, 1971-NMCA-129, 83 N.M. 152, 489 P.2d 660, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 151, 489 P.2d 659.  
Legal incidence of gross receipts tax on seller. — The statutory language defining services places the legal incidence of the gross receipts tax on the seller. United States v. New Mexico, 581 F.2d 803 (10th Cir. 1978), aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).  
Taxpayers must treat transactions uniformly for all purposes within the tax scheme and not attempt to show, first, a lease for federal purposes and second, a nontaxable event for state purposes. Co-Con, Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1974-NMCA-134, 87 N.M. 118, 529 P.2d 1239, cert. denied, 87 N.M. 111, 529 P.2d 1232.  
If purchase order not transfer for consideration, then not sale. — The wording of taxpayer's purchase orders and contract, together with evidence that taxpayer invoiced only for chemicals and reagents delivered to a well and retained payment only for what was used, support the inference that a purchase order was not a transfer for consideration and therefore not a sale; therefore, since no single delivery or single day's delivery to a well ever amounted to 18 tons or more, of chemicals or reagents, although the amount specified in a purchase order might aggregate that much, taxpayer was not entitled to a deduction under Section 7-9-65 NMSA 1978. Runco Acidizing & Fracturing Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1974-NMCA-145, 87 N.M. 146, 530 P.2d 410.  
Corporations separate entities for taxation purposes. — Taxpayers, a parent corporation and its 100%-owned subsidiary cannot escape corporate liability for joint 
use of equipment merely because the shareholders of one of the corporations own all the equipment in question. The two corporations must be treated as separate entities for taxation purposes. Co-Con, Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1974-NMCA-134, 87 N.M. 118, 529 P.2d 1239, cert. denied, 87 N.M. 111, 529 P.2d 1232.  
Renting or leasing is a "use" of property. Rust Tractor Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1970-NMCA-107, 82 N.M. 82, 475 P.2d 779, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 81, 475 P.2d 778.  
Granting of license. — The 1991 amendments to this section marked a significant change in the treatment of the granting of a license. Kmart Corp. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't., 2006-NMSC-006, 139 N.M. 172, 131 P.3d 22.  
Receipts to owner and trainer of horse subject to tax. — The legislature, in enacting the Gross Receipts Tax Act, did not intend to exempt receipts from horse races. There is neither ambiguity nor doubt that the language used in the Gross Receipts Tax Act applies to the receipts of a horse owner paid to him for a winning purse and the receipts of a horse trainer paid to him as his percentage of a winning purse. Till v. Jones, 1972-NMCA-046, 83 N.M. 743, 497 P.2d 745, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 740, 497 P.2d 742. See Section 7-9-40 NMSA 1978 which now exempts receipts from horse race purses.  
Disbursement agents of federal funds immune from gross receipts tax. — Agents for the disbursement of federal funds are constitutionally immune from application of the gross receipts tax to those funds. United States v. New Mexico, 624 F.2d 111 (10th Cir. 1980), aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).

I. BUSINESS. 
Meaning of "business". — "Business" is that which occupies the time, attention and labor of a person for the purpose of livelihood, profit or improvement; that which is a person's concern or intent. It would be too narrow a view to hold that if appellant's intelligence, skill and labor is employed in New Mexico, he is not carrying on a business, trade or profession in this state. Sterling Title Co. v. Comm'r of Revenue, 1973-NMCA-086, 85 N.M. 279, 511 P.2d 765.  
"Engaging in business" means carrying on or causing to be carried on any activity for the purpose of direct or indirect benefit to the taxpayer (American Automobile Association), not someone else (its members). AAA v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMSC-012, 87 N.M. 330, 533 P.2d 103, rev'd on other grounds, 1975-NMSC-058, 88 N.M. 462, 541 P.2d 967.  
"Engaging in business". — A taxpayer is "engaging in business" as defined by Subsection E (now Section 7-9-3.3 NMSA 1978) when it is doing what it was organized and authorized to do. Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream Co. v. Revenue Div., 1979-NMCA-098, 93 N.M. 301, 599 P.2d 1098.  
To decide whether one's activity constitutes "engaging in business" in this state, the real question is whether the sale or lease is in line with the business for which the seller or lessor was organized and in which it engages. AAMCO Transmissions v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1979-NMCA-092, 93 N.M. 389, 600 P.2d 841, cert. denied, 93 N.M. 205, 598 P.2d 1165.  
To engage in business, taxpayer must engage in services "for other persons" with the purpose of direct or indirect benefit to itself, for which activity it receives money for the performance of its services. Twining Coop. Domestic Water & Sewer Ass'n v. Bureau of Revenue, 1976-NMCA-052, 89 N.M. 345, 552 P.2d 476, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 7, 558 P.2d 619.  
Bookkeeping and management corporation engaged in business. — Corporation organized to centralize the bookkeeping and management functions for other corporations was engaged in business for purposes of this act. Westland Corp. v. Commissioner of Revenue, 1971-NMCA-083, 83 N.M. 29, 487 P.2d 1099, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 22, 487 P.2d 1092.  
Independent contractor subject to gross receipts taxes. — Since carpenter did "fifty to one hundred and fifty" jobs for different people, on those jobs where the customer (employer) deducted F.I.C.A. taxes, carpenter was an employee and his compensation 
was exempt as wages, and where no deductions were made, the commissioner determined that he was an independent contractor and liable for payment of gross receipt taxes. Stohr v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1976-NMCA-118, 90 N.M. 43, 559 P.2d 420, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 254, 561 P.2d 1347 (1977).  
Foreign franchisor deemed "engaging in business". — A foreign corporation which enters into agreements as a franchisor with licensees in New Mexico for use of the franchisor's trade name and trademark is engaged in business in New Mexico. American Dairy Queen Corp. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1979-NMCA-160, 93 N.M. 743, 605 P.2d 251.  
Incidence of tax on contractors selling services to United States. — The legal incidence of the gross receipts tax was on contractors as sellers of services to the United States, not on the federal government. United States v. New Mexico, 581 F.2d 803 (10th Cir. 1978).  
II. PROPERTY. 
Meaning of "license". — As "license" is not defined in the statutes, it is accordingly to be given its ordinary meaning unless a different intent is clearly indicated and as "license" is defined in terms of "to accord permission or consent," "allow," "authorize," and as "permission to act," the essential element in the creation of a license is the permission or consent of the licensor and this permission need not come from some government authority. N.M. Sheriffs & Police Ass'n v. Bureau of Revenue, 1973-NMCA-130, 85 N.M. 565, 514 P.2d 616.  
Rental of space in department store held license. — Agreements entered into between the taxpayer and several other companies which provided for the use of space in the taxpayer's department stores for the purpose of retailing certain items were license agreements and receipts from these arrangements were taxable under this section. S.S. Kresge Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-015, 87 N.M. 259, 531 P.2d 1232.  
Franchises. — For purposes of the gross receipts tax act, a franchise is to be treated as a compound or "bundled" form of property, which typically includes a license to use the franchiser's trademark and a commitment by the franchiser to perform various services to assist the franchisee in the operation of the franchised business. Services that are required by the franchise agreement and any services provided by the franchiser to police, promote, maintain, or enhance the value of its franchise system, are part of the franchise, and this is so regardless of whether those services are performed in New Mexico or out-of-state. Sonic Indus., Inc. v. State, 2000-NMCA-087, 129 N.M. 657, 11 P.3d 1219, rev'd on other grounds, 2006-NMSC-038, 140 N.M. 212, 141 P.3d 1266.  
Telephone communications not tangible personalty. — The decision of the commission that a telephone company which provided a private telephone line to a 
federal agency was not entitled to the deduction in Section 7-9-54 NMSA 1978 for the sale of tangible personal property was upheld by the appellate court which found a reasonable basis for differentiating between electricity (declared to be tangible personalty at Section 7-9-3J NMSA 1978) and telephone communications. Leaco Rural Tel. Coop., Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1974-NMCA-076, 86 N.M. 629, 526 P.2d 426.  
III. SERVICES. 
Amendment to definition of service changed test from product's value to seller's activity. — The 1976 amendment to the definition of service changed the test for taxation from one focusing on the end product's value to the purchaser to one focusing on the nature of seller's activity; on the seller's relative investment of skills and materials. EG & G, Inc. v. Dir., Revenue Div. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1979-NMCA-139, 94 N.M. 143, 607 P.2d 1161, cert. denied, 94 N.M. 628, 614 P.2d 545.  
Service to its members does not constitute "service to others" as stated in the definition of "service" in this section. Twining Coop. Domestic Water & Sewer Ass'n v. Bureau of Revenue, 1976-NMCA-052, 89 N.M. 345, 552 P.2d 476, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 7, 558 P.2d 619.  
Meaning of "other persons" doubtful. — The words "other persons" have many meanings which make the words doubtful as to meaning. When this occurs, "all doubts as to the meaning and intent of a tax statute must be construed in favor of the taxpayer." Twining Coop. Domestic Water & Sewer Ass'n v. Bureau of Revenue, 1976-NMCA-052, 89 N.M. 345, 552 P.2d 476, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 7, 558 P.2d 619.  
Intent of legislature to grant tax immunity to nonprofit corporation. — The intent of the legislature was to grant immunity from the Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax Act to a nonprofit corporation which rendered services solely to its members for an assessment or a charge. Twining Coop. Domestic Water & Sewer Ass'n v. Bureau of Revenue, 1976-NMCA-052, 89 N.M. 345, 552 P.2d 476, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 7, 558 P.2d 619.  
Building contractor performs "service". — A contractor in the business of constructing buildings is not a seller of construction materials but performs a service as defined in Subsection K. Ramah Navajo Sch. Bd., Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1980-NMCA-094, 95 N.M. 708, 625 P.2d 1225, cert. quashed, 96 N.M. 17, 627 P.2d 412 (1981), rev'd on other grounds, 458 U.S. 832, 102 S. Ct. 3394, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1174 (1982).  
School board contracting to build school. — When an Indian school board contracts with a federal agency to construct a school on reservation property and, in turn, contracts with a general contractor for actual construction of the building, the school board is the owner of the building and not an entity engaged in the construction business within the meaning of Subsection K. Ramah Navajo Sch. Bd., Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1980-NMCA-094, 95 N.M. 708, 625 P.2d 1225, cert. quashed, 96 N.M. 17, 
627 P.2d 412 (1981), rev'd on other grounds, 458 U.S. 832, 102 S. Ct. 3394, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1174 (1982).  
Horse trainer and owner performing for others are performing "service". — When both a horse trainer and a horse owner are engaged in activities for other persons for a consideration, receipts in question were receipts from performing a service within the meaning of the Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax Act. Till v. Jones, 1972-NMCA-046, 83 N.M. 743, 497 P.2d 745, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 740, 497 P.2d 742. See Section 7-9-40 NMSA 1978 which now exempts receipts from horse race purses.  
That part of attorney's inheritance designated attorney fees taxable. — Since attorney who was sole heir to his father's estate listed part of the inheritance received as attorney fees, that portion so designated was taxable under the gross receipts tax. Mears v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-006, 87 N.M. 240, 531 P.2d 1213.  
Director's fees for services to corporation. — A member of the board of directors of a corporation was performing a service for the corporation and his fees therefrom are taxable as gross receipts. Mears v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-006, 87 N.M. 240, 531 P.2d 1213.  
Municipal franchise fee and telephone carriers. — The total amount of money received by a local carrier for selling its telephone services includes the amount identified on its bills as the customer's share of the municipal franchise fee, so a telephone carrier is subject to the gross receipts tax. GTE Sw. Inc. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1992-NMCA-024, 113 N.M. 610, 830 P.2d 162, cert. denied, 113 N.M. 605, 830 P.2d 157.  
Billboard displays intrastate in character. — Taxpayer's service is simply to post messages on billboards located in this state. It is being taxed for displaying, not for advertising. This service is intrastate in character, and thus is subject to the gross receipts tax. Mountain States Adver., Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1976-NMCA-058, 89 N.M. 331, 552 P.2d 233, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 8, 558 P.2d 620.

History: 1978 Comp., § 7-9-3.4, enacted by Laws 2003, ch. 272, § 5; 2020, ch. 80, § 4.  
ANNOTATIONS 
The 2020 amendment, effective July 1, 2021, defined "construction-related service" as used in the Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax Act; in the section heading, added "and construction-related services"; and added Subsection C. 
Construction work incidental to "severing" exempt from gross receipts tax. — The exemption provided by Section 7-9-35 NMSA 1978 applied, since "severing" was taking place as the development work was performed and none of taxpayer's work was preliminary to or preparatory for "severing"; therefore, receipts from development work, which includes construction, were exempted from the gross receipts tax and taxable under the service tax (resources excise tax) when such construction work was incidental to the "severing." Patten v. Bureau of Revenue, 1974-NMCA-051, 86 N.M. 355, 524 P.2d 527.  
"Fence" not a "structure". — The word "structure", which follows "building" and "stadium," is limited in its meaning to things or classes of the same general character as buildings and stadia and this does not include fences. Cardinal Fence Co. v. Commissioner of Bureau of Revenue, 1972-NMCA-136, 84 N.M. 314, 502 P.2d 1004 (decided under prior law).  
Fence not within definition of "construction". — Construction of fences does not come within the definition of "construction"in that the fencing material sold is not a component part of a construction project. Cardinal Fence Co. v. Commissioner of Bureau of Revenue, 1972-NMCA-136, 84 N.M. 314, 502 P.2d 1004 (decided under prior law).  
Erection of fences not construction. — Since the construction of fences does not come within the definition of "construction", fencing material sold with or without setting of the posts did not become a component part of a construction project and receipts from such sales were deductible. Cardinal Fence Co. v. Commissioner of Bureau of Revenue, 1972-NMCA-136, 84 N.M. 314, 502 P.2d 1004 (decided under prior law).  
Non-Indians performing construction services for tribe subject to tax. — Under the gross receipts tax act, non-Indian contractors involved in the construction of an Indian resort complex are subject to a tax on the gross receipts they received for performing construction services. The legal incidence of the tax falls upon them and not upon the tribe or tribal property. The state is imposing the tax solely on non-Indians who have performed services for the tribe. Mescalero Apache Tribe v. O'Cheskey, 439 F. Supp. 1063 (D.N.M. 1977), aff'd, 625 F.2d 967 (10th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 959, 101 S. Ct. 1417, 67 L. Ed. 2d 383 (1981), reh'g denied, 455 U.S. 929, 102 S. Ct. 1296, 71 L. Ed. 2d 474 (1982).  
Imposition of tax on tribal organization impermissible. — If the economic burden of the gross receipts tax ultimately falls on a tribal organization, even though the legal incidence of the tax falls on the non-Indian contractor with whom the organization contracted to build an Indian school, the imposition of the tax impermissibly impedes the clearly expressed federal interest in promoting the quality and quantity of educational opportunities for Indians by depleting the funds available for the construction of Indian schools. Ramah Navajo Sch. Bd., Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 458 U.S. 832, 102 S. Ct. 3394, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1174 (1982).  
Federal regulatory scheme and policy. — The comprehensive federal regulatory scheme and the express federal policy of encouraging tribal self-sufficiency in the area of education preclude the imposition of the state gross receipts tax on the construction of school facilities on tribal lands pursuant to a contract between a tribal organization and a non-Indian contracting firm. Ramah Navajo Sch. Bd., Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 458 U.S. 832, 102 S. Ct. 3394, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1174 (1982).  
Construction project includes wide variety of activities. — This section was intended to make sales of construction materials to governmental entities taxable when the materials were to be incorporated into construction projects. Contrary to taxpayer's argument that Regulation GR 51:16 (now 3.2.1.11) establishes a definite test for determining whether an endeavor is a "construction project," this regulation merely states nonexclusive guidelines for determining whether materials constitute a component part of a construction project. Thus, construction projects include the wide variety of activities listed in Subsection C. Arco Materials, Inc. v. State Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1994-NMCA-062, 118 N.M. 12, 878 P.2d 330, rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Blaze Constr. Co. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1994-NMSC-110, 118 N.M. 647, 884 P.2d 803, cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1016, 115 S. Ct. 1359, 131 L. Ed. 2d 216 (1995).  
"Construction" deemed question of fact. — Whether activities of a party constitute "construction" is a question of fact for a jury. United States v. New Mexico, 642 F.2d 397 (10th Cir. 1981).   
7-9-3.5. Definition; gross receipts. 
A. As used in the Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax Act:  
(1) "gross receipts" means the total amount of money or the value of other consideration received from selling property in New Mexico, from leasing or licensing property employed in New Mexico, from granting a right to use a franchise employed in New Mexico, from selling services performed outside New Mexico, the product of which is initially used in New Mexico, or from performing services in New Mexico.  In an exchange in which the money or other consideration received does not represent the value of the property or service exchanged, "gross receipts" means the reasonable value of the property or service exchanged; 
(2) "gross receipts" includes: 
(a) any receipts from sales of tangible personal property handled on consignment; 
(b) the total commissions or fees derived from the business of buying, selling or promoting the purchase, sale or lease, as an agent or broker on a commission or fee basis, of any property, service, stock, bond or security; 
(c) amounts paid by members of any cooperative association or similar organization for sales or leases of personal property or performance of services by such organization; 
(d) amounts received from transmitting messages or conversations by persons providing telephone or telegraph services; 
(e) amounts received by a New Mexico florist from the sale of flowers, plants or other products that are customarily sold by florists where the sale is made pursuant to orders placed with the New Mexico florist that are filled and delivered outside New Mexico by an out-of-state florist; 
(f) the receipts of a home service provider from providing mobile telecommunications services to customers whose place of primary use is in New Mexico if:  1) the mobile telecommunications services originate and terminate in the same state, regardless of where the services originate, terminate or pass through; and 2) the charges for mobile telecommunications services are billed by or for a customer's home service provider and are deemed provided by the home service provider.  For the purposes of this section, "home service provider", "mobile telecommunications services", "customer" and "place of primary use" have the meanings given in the federal Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act; and 
(g) receipts collected by a marketplace provider engaging in business in the state from sales, leases and licenses of tangible personal property, sales of licenses and sales of services or licenses for use of real property that are sourced to this state and are facilitated by the marketplace provider on behalf of marketplace sellers, regardless of whether the marketplace sellers are engaging in business in the state; and  
(3) "gross receipts" excludes: 
(a) cash discounts allowed and taken; 
(b) New Mexico gross receipts tax, governmental gross receipts tax, leased vehicle gross receipts tax, and cannabis excise tax payable on transactions for the reporting period; 
(c) taxes imposed pursuant to the provisions of any local option gross receipts tax that is payable on transactions for the reporting period; 
(d) any gross receipts or sales taxes imposed by an Indian nation, tribe or pueblo; provided that the tax is approved, if approval is required by federal law or regulation, by the secretary of the interior of the United States; and provided further that the gross receipts or sales tax imposed by the Indian nation, tribe or pueblo provides a reciprocal exclusion for gross receipts, sales or gross receipts-based excise taxes imposed by the state or its political subdivisions; 
(e) any type of time-price differential;  
(f) amounts received solely on behalf of another in a disclosed agency capacity; and 
(g) amounts received by a New Mexico florist from the sale of flowers, plants or other products that are customarily sold by florists where the sale is made pursuant to orders placed with an out-of-state florist for filling and delivery in New Mexico by a New Mexico florist. 
B. When the sale of property or service is made under any type of charge, conditional or time-sales contract or the leasing of property is made under a leasing contract, the seller or lessor may elect to treat all receipts, excluding any type of time-price differential, under such contracts as gross receipts as and when the payments are actually received.  If the seller or lessor transfers the seller's or lessor's interest in any such contract to a third person, the seller or lessor shall pay the gross receipts tax upon the full sale or leasing contract amount, excluding any type of time-price differential.

Entities may take medical services tax deduction on behalf of health care practitioner employees. — Where taxpayer, a medical staffing company that had commercial contracts with the department of veterans affairs and the Indian health service, claimed a gross receipts tax deduction for the provision of medical services on behalf of its nurse employees, and where the department of taxation and revenue claimed that the deduction was limited to individual health care practitioners, the administrative hearing officer did not err in concluding that taxpayer satisfied the basic criteria for the deduction, because the regulation implementing NMSA 1978, § 7-9-93 permits an employer entity to take the deduction on behalf of an employee, provided that the entity is not otherwise excluded and the remaining requirements under the statute are satisfied, and in this case, the parties stipulated that taxpayer is not an excluded health care facility under the regulation, and the stipulated facts establish that all the conditions of § 7-9-93 were met.  Robison v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep't, 2023-NMCA-065.  
I. IN GENERAL. 
"Gross receipts" means the total amount of money or the value of other considerations received from selling property or from performing services. N.M. Enters., Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1974-NMCA-125, 86 N.M. 799, 528 P.2d 212.  
Selling property in New Mexico. — The gross receipts tax only applies when the selling of property takes place within the borders of New Mexico. Kmart Corp. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't., 2006-NMSC-006, 139 N.M. 172, 131 P.3d 22.  
Royalties received from trademark licenses granted as part of a franchise are subject to gross receipts tax. — Where petitioner entered into a number of franchise agreements with New Mexico businesses which contained a provision to grant to franchisees a limited license to use specific trademarks, and where the New Mexico taxation and revenue department (department) determined that the royalty fees for the limited trademark licenses were subject to gross receipts tax, the district court did not err in granting the department’s motion for summary judgment, because the definition of “gross receipts” includes the total amount of money or the value of other consideration received from granting a right to use a franchise employed in New Mexico, and the trademark licensing provision at issue was central to the overall franchise and should be treated as part of the franchise for purposes of gross receipts, regardless of whether it was separately stated and itemized in the franchise agreement. A&W Rests. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep’t, 2018-NMCA-069, cert. denied.  
Salaries and overhead of federal contractors not tax immune. — As long as federal contractors are separate entities solely responsible for their own employees and internal management, salaries and overhead of those contractors are not obligations of the government, for purposes of tax immunity. United States v. New Mexico, 624 F.2d 111 (10th Cir. 1980), aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).  
Collection agencies gross receipts. — A collection agency does not include the creditor's portion of the proceeds, nor the taxes it collects on behalf of the creditor, in calculating its commission proceeds, i.e., its gross receipts. Rather, a collection agency pays gross receipts tax only on the commission portion of the debt. The total tax imposed on the debt and charged to the debtor is simply the sum of the creditor's tax and the agency's tax. Martinez v. Albuquerque Collection Servs., Inc., 867 F. Supp. 1495 (D.N.M. 1994).  
Temporary staffing agencies' gross receipts. — Temporary employee company was not excluded from paying tax on its gross receipts from clients to which it provided temporary staffing services; the receipts were taxable as reimbursements of payroll-related expenditure. MPC Ltd. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2003-NMCA-021, 133 N.M. 217, 62 P.3d 308.  
II. OUT-OF-STATE. 
Only activities within state taxable. — The validity of the application of the gross receipts tax to general and administrative expense reimbursements depended on whether the tax was laid upon gross receipts derived from the contractors' activities within the borders of the state. United States v. New Mexico, 581 F.2d 803 (10th Cir. 1978), aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).  
Work performed outside the state. — If when they received reimbursements for general and administrative expenses contractors were being reimbursed for work (whether called "services" or by any other name) performed outside the state, New Mexico taxing authorities lack authority to tax those transactions. United States v. New Mexico, 581 F.2d 803 (10th Cir. 1978), aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).  
Income accrues on an out-of-state transaction. — Income which arises from a contract performed within the state but accrues upon a separable out-of-state transaction should be excluded from taxation as not being income arising from contracting within the state. United States v. New Mexico, 581 F.2d 803 (10th Cir. 1978), aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).  
Mere accounting device will not avoid tax. — Since all receipts resulted solely from the contractor's activities in the state and the general and administrative expense category appeared merely to be a cost accounting device, the entire amount of the receipts may be taxed by the state. United States v. New Mexico, 581 F.2d 803 (10th Cir. 1978), aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).  
Apportionment between in-state and out-of-state activity does not arise if the tax is levied only upon receipts resulting from the taxpayer's activities in New Mexico. Mountain States Adver., Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1976-NMCA-058, 89 N.M. 331, 552 P.2d 233, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 8, 558 P.2d 620.  
Tax on foreign corporation's local business does not offend commerce clause. — Gross receipts tax imposed on foreign corporation was conditioned on the local business of renting equipment located in the state. Therefore, the tax does not constitute an undue burden on interstate commerce but, on the contrary, was a tax on the taxpayers' local and intrastate business of leasing machinery. Besser Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1964-NMSC-169, 74 N.M. 377, 394 P.2d 141 (decided under prior gross receipts law).  
Taxing out-of-state sales impermissible. — Tax levied on gross receipts from out-of-state sales of tangible personal property, in the nature of reproducible educational material, is an impermissible burden on commerce. Evco v. Jones, 409 U.S. 91, 93 S. Ct. 349, 34 L. Ed. 2d 325 (1972).  
Entire revenue from nonresident's display of signs in state taxable. — Colorado corporation which displayed billboards made in Colorado by Colorado employees and whose only contact with New Mexico was the displaying of signs and using 10% of its cost in maintenance was held subject to this section for its entire revenue and not just its 10% cost of maintenance. Mountain States Adver., Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1976-NMCA-058, 89 N.M. 331, 552 P.2d 233, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 8, 558 P.2d 620.  
Only value of property entering state taxed. — Where tuition paid by New Mexico residents to a correspondence school based in Illinois covered materials valued at an average cost of $50 per student, and the remainder of the tuition covered the costs of grading, counseling and other services connected with the educational programs, virtually all of which services were performed in Illinois, it was held that only the value of the property entering New Mexico could be taxed as gross receipts of the school. Advance Schs., Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1976-NMSC-007, 89 N.M. 79, 547 P.2d 562.  
Affirmative evidence needed to support use within state. — When the corporation contracted with an out-of-state buyer provided for the corporation to destroy munitions, it was entitled to the gross receipts deduction, and the hearing officer could not properly determine that use or delivery took place within the state without some affirmative evidence in the record to support that conclusion. TPL, Inc. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2003-NMSC-007, 133 N.M. 447, 64 P.3d 474.  
Tax applicable to foreign franchisor. — Although franchisor has no payroll, real property, personnel or offices located in this state, it does furnish signs which must be leased or purchased by its dealers, and its sales of tangible property and its granting of exclusive franchises constitute engaging in intrastate business in this state and the franchise fees received therefrom are subject to the gross receipts tax. AAMCO 
Transmissions v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1979-NMCA-092, 93 N.M. 389, 600 P.2d 841, cert. denied, 93 N.M. 205, 598 P.2d 1165. (Superceded by statute, Sonic Indus., Inc. v. State, 2000-NMCA-087, 129 N.M. 657, 11 P.3d 1219.)  
Application of tax to franchise fees. — The imposition of gross receipts tax on franchise fees received from this state's dealers does not violate the due process clause or commerce clause and is proper where the franchisor is in the business of selling franchises, developing and marketing parts, receiving its primary source of income from the sale of franchises, collecting a percentage of franchisee's gross receipts as a lease payment for use of the trademark and trade name and where its leased trademarks and trade names and their businesses are protected by the laws of this state; thus, franchisor is engaged in business in this state. AAMCO Transmissions v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1979-NMCA-092, 93 N.M. 389, 600 P.2d 841, cert. denied, 93 N.M. 205, 598 P.2d 1165. (Superceded by statute, Sonic Indus., Inc. v. State, 2000-NMCA-087, 129 N.M. 657, 11 P.3d 1219.)  
The 1991 amendment of Subsection J reclassifying licensing as selling did not alter whatever economic nexus existing between a foreign corporation and commercial activity carried on within New Mexico by its franchisees; therefore, fees paid to the corporation by New Mexico franchisees for the right to operate its restaurants located in New Mexico constituted receipts from selling property in New Mexico and were gross receipts within the meaning of Subsection F. Sonic Indus., Inc. v. State, 2000-NMCA-087, 129 N.M. 657, 11 P.3d 1219, rev'd, 2006-NMSC-038, 140 N.M. 212, 141 P.3d 1266.  
Tax applicable to foreign corporation. — Although the taxpayer, a Delaware corporation, has no employees or offices located in this state, the taxpayer's most valuable assets, its trade name, trademark and related intangibles, are used in this state, taxpayer's secret formulas and techniques are utilized in this state and its method of business exploits the New Mexico market for taxpayer's benefit, taxpayer is engaged in business in New Mexico for purposes of gross receipts tax. Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream Co. v. Revenue Div., 1979-NMCA-098, 93 N.M. 301, 599 P.2d 1098 (decided under prior law).  
III. LEASES. 
Receipt of money from leasing of property is the incident which gave rise to the imposition of the gross receipts and sales tax. Rust Tractor Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1970-NMCA-107, 82 N.M. 82, 475 P.2d 779, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 81, 475 P.2d 778.  
Property lease royalties are "gross receipts." — When a taxpayer is leasing property in this state for which it receives royalties, the royalties are "gross receipts." Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream Co. v. Revenue Div., 1979-NMCA-098, 93 N.M. 301, 599 P.2d 1098 (decided under prior law).  
Gross receipts tax levied upon lessor of equipment, not user. Co-Con, Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1974-NMCA-134, 87 N.M. 118, 529 P.2d 1239, cert. denied, 87 N.M. 111, 529 P.2d 1232.  
Treating transactions as rentals for federal tax implies leasing arrangements. — When a parent corporation and its 100%-owned subsidiary utilized certain items of equipment without regard to which held the legal title thereto, made accounting entries showing the machinery as either "receivable" or "liability," as appropriate, and treated the transactions as gross rentals for federal corporate income tax purposes, the intent of the taxpayers was to treat the arrangements as rentals or leases which were subject to gross receipts taxes. Co-Con, Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1974-NMCA-134, 87 N.M. 118, 529 P.2d 1239, cert. denied, 87 N.M. 111, 529 P.2d 1232.  
Effect of Bingo and Raffle Act [repealed] on lease. — An arrangement between the owner of several properties used as bingo halls and the non-profit organizations who operated the bingo games was a lease and not a license where the organizations were required to pay rent, they were granted exclusive possession of certain facilities on the premises and the use of the facilities at certain times, and the owner could not revoke the agreement at will; although the arrangement was not a typical lease, restrictions in the Bingo and Raffle Act [repealed] accounted for the type of arrangement created and to deny that this was a lease would have made it impossible for bingo operators to enter arrangements that would qualify as leases. Quantum Corp. v. State Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1998-NMCA-050, 125 N.M. 49, 956 P.2d 848 (decided under Bingo and Raffle Act, since repealed).  
Laundry transactions are leasings. — Since the taxpayer's coin-operated laundry business is used for a consideration by persons other than the owner, the transactions are "leasings" as defined in Subsection J and the taxpayer is entitled to a deduction from compensating tax liability for the value of the washers and dryers. Strebeck Props., Inc. v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1979-NMCA-035, 93 N.M. 262, 599 P.2d 1059.  
Franchisor's arrangements with its licensees fall within definition of "leasing." American Dairy Queen Corp. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1979-NMCA-160, 93 N.M. 743, 605 P.2d 251 (decided under prior law).  
Granting of license. — The 1991 amendments to this section clearly mandate a departure from treating the granting of a license as a lease to treating the granting of a license as a sale of a license. Kmart Corp. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't., 2006-NMSC-006, 139 N.M. 172, 131 P.3d 22.  
Shelf-display contract receipts. — Taxpayer's appeal of the hearing officer's decision and order upholding the department's assessments of a gross receipts tax and penalty was improper where she failed to overcome the statutory presumption that all receipts were taxable; the buy-down contract payments were reimbursements to the taxpayer for her sales loss incurred as a result of engaging in the discount promotions and the shelf-display contract receipts were taxable because those contracts bore a much greater 
resemblance to a license than to the creation and conveyance of an interest in real property that would have constituted a lease. Grogan v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2003-NMCA-033, 133 N.M. 354, 62 P.3d 1236, cert. denied, 133 N.M. 413, 63 P.3d 516.  
IV. TIME-PRICE DIFFERENTIAL. 
To be taxable must be bargained for before work finished. — In order to be taxable as a "time-price differential sale," the money in question must have been bargained for before the contract work was rendered and the final invoice delivered, and when taxpayer accepted a promissory note secured by a mortgage after it had completed its work, the additional money paid on the note was in the nature of interest and could not be characterized as "time-price" for the purposes of this section and therefore the tax as imposed by the bureau was inapplicable. Co-Con, Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1974-NMCA-134, 87 N.M. 118, 529 P.2d 1239, cert. denied, 87 N.M. 111, 529 P.2d 1232 (decided under prior law).  
Time-price differential sale not taxed if no part of which was gross receipt. — Taxpayer was not liable for state and municipal gross receipts taxes on time-price differential of installment sales contract sold to financial institution since no part of time-price differential was a "gross receipt" under the statute chargeable to taxpayer. Davis v. Comm'r of Revenue, 1971-NMCA-129, 83 N.M. 152, 489 P.2d 660, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 151, 489 P.2d 659 (decided prior to the 1972 amendment which changed Subsection F's treatment of time-price differential arrangements).  
Fees taxable even if not approved by court. — Taxpayer was liable for the gross receipts tax assessed against fees actually received and used by the taxpayer, although the fees had not been approved by the bankruptcy court. Lopez v. N.M. Dep't of Taxation & Revenue, 1997-NMCA-115, 124 N.M. 270, 949 P.2d 284, cert. denied, 124 N.M. 311, 950 P.2d 284.  
V. AGENTS. 
"Dealer concessions" retained from mutual fund transactions fall within the terms "commissions or fees" as used in this section. Rauscher, Pierce, Refsnes, Inc. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2002-NMSC-013, 132 N.M. 226, 46 P.3d 687.  
No agency when purchases for others merely incidental to work. — Carpenter was not liable for assessment of gross receipts tax on purchases of materials since he did not receive any commissions or fees, but acted merely as an agent for his customers, and the purchases were merely incidental to his work as a carpenter. Stohr v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1976-NMCA-118, 90 N.M. 43, 559 P.2d 420, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 254, 561 P.2d 1347 (1977).  
No agency when purchaser consultant to client-buyers. — When taxpayer, engaged in the business of management consultation, supervision and administration 
for motels, bought large quantities of tangible personal property at wholesale and sold them to its clients without additional cost or profit, the taxpayer was not a factor, agent or broker for its motel clients and was taxable for the total amount of money received from its sale to the motel clients of the tangible personal property under the Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax Act. N.M. Enters., Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1974-NMCA-125, 86 N.M. 799, 528 P.2d 212.  
Term "broker" as used in this section includes a person selling securities on behalf of others. Rauscher, Pierce, Refsnes, Inc. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2002-NMSC-013, 132 N.M. 226, 46 P.3d 687.  
7-9-4. Imposition and rate of tax; denomination as "gross receipts tax". 
A. For the privilege of engaging in business, an excise tax equal to the following percentages of gross receipts is imposed on any person engaging in business in New Mexico: 
(1) prior to July 1, 2023, five percent; and 
(2) beginning July 1, 2023, four and seven-eighths percent, except as provided in Subsection C of this section. 
B. The tax imposed by this section shall be referred to as the "gross receipts tax". 
C. If, for any single fiscal year occurring after fiscal year 2025 and prior to fiscal year 2030, gross receipts tax revenues are less than ninety-five percent of the gross receipts tax revenues for the previous fiscal year, as determined by the secretary of finance and administration, the rate of the gross receipts tax shall be five and one-eighth percent beginning on the July 1 following the determination made by the secretary of finance and administration. 
D. On or before February 1 of each year, until the rate of the gross receipts tax is adjusted to five and one-eighth percent pursuant to Subsection C of this section, the secretary of finance and administration shall make a determination for the purposes of Subsection C of this section.  If the rate of tax is adjusted pursuant to that subsection, the secretary shall certify to the secretary of taxation and revenue that the rate of the gross receipts tax shall be five and one-eighth percent, effective on the following July 1. 
E. As used in this section, "gross receipts tax revenues" means the net receipts attributable to the gross receipts tax and distributed to the general fund.

I. GENERAL CONSIDERATION. 
Reasonable tax classifications not unconstitutional. — It is for the legislature to adopt classifications for the imposition of excise taxes as it may deem proper and any reasonable classification cannot be held to deny equal protection or due process. Edmunds v. Bureau of Revenue, 1958-NMSC-112, 64 N.M. 454, 330 P.2d 131.  
Legislature's method of imposing gross receipts and compensating tax reasonable. — The legislature's selection of the vendor for imposition of the school tax (gross receipts tax since repealed) and of the purchaser for imposition of the former compensating tax was reasonable in view of the impossibility of subjecting a nonresident vendor - one who was out of the territorial jurisdiction of the legislature - to the school tax. Edmunds v. Bureau of Revenue, 1958-NMSC-112, 64 N.M. 454, 330 P.2d 131.  
Legislative failure to protect resident-vendor not unconstitutional. — The failure of the legislature to protect resident-vendor against the unfair competition of importations into New Mexico, without the payment of a sales tax, of chemical reagents did not offend the constitutions of either the United States or of New Mexico so as to invalidate the school tax against him. Edmunds v. Bureau of Revenue, 1958-NMSC-112, 64 N.M. 454, 330 P.2d 131 (decided under former law).  
Standard of review on appeal. — Department's gross receipts tax assessment can only be reversed by the court of appeals if arbitrary or capricious, or there is an abuse of discretion, such that the assessment is not supported by substantial evidence or it is otherwise not in accordance with law. ITT Educ. Serv. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1998-NMCA-078, 125 N.M. 244, 959 P.2d 969.  
Department not precluded from assessing taxes where taxpayers failed to establish the elements of collateral estoppel, corporation by estoppel, or judicial estoppel. — Where taxpayers appealed a 2018 assessment of taxes for the 2011 tax 
year, arising from the operation of an automotive technician business, and where defendant argued that the taxation and revenue department (Department) was precluded on estoppel grounds from personally assessing unpaid 2011 gross receipts tax against taxpayers, the Department was not precluded from assessing unpaid gross receipts tax against taxpayers personally, because taxpayers failed to establish the elements of collateral estoppel, failed to demonstrate that corporation by estoppel applied to the facts of the case, and failed to establish any evidence that warranted applying judicial estoppel. Vigil v. N.M. Tax'n and Revenue Dep't, 2022-NMCA-032. 
The evidence supports the department's personal assessment against taxpayer for business's tax liability. — Where taxpayer appealed a 2018 assessment of taxes for the 2011 tax year, arising from the operation of an automotive technician business, and where defendant argued that taxpayer was not personally liable for gross receipts taxes owed by the business, contending that he did not participate in the operations of the business, the hearing officer did not err in determining that taxpayer held himself out as a corporation, and was therefore personally liable for the business's tax debt, because taxpayer contributed money to the business, was an initial director and incorporator, remained a director and incorporator until 2011, when the business filed articles of incorporation for the second time, signed financing statements and purchased and registered vehicles for the business, taxpayer's credit was used by the business, and taxpayer made payments for property and equipment and guaranteed loans. Taxpayer's course of conduct in relation to the business reasonably demonstrated that he assumed to act as a corporation, and § 53-18-9 NMSA 1978, provides that all persons who assume to act as a corporation without authority to do so are jointly and severally liable for all debts and liabilities incurred or arising as a result thereof. Vigil v. N.M. Tax'n and Revenue Dep't, 2022-NMCA-032.  
II. APPLICABILITY. 
Only a person engaging in business may be liable for gross receipts tax. — Under the plain language of this section, the taxation and revenue department may only impose gross receipts tax upon persons who were engaging in business when the tax liability was incurred.  New Mexico Depo v. N.M. Tax’n & Revenue Dep’t, 2021-NMCA-011. 
Department lacked authority to impose tax liability against taxpayer who was not engaged in business at the time the tax liability was incurred. — Where in 2009, taxpayer established a business that provided court reporting services, registered with the taxation and revenue department (department), was assigned a Combined Reporting System (CRS) number for tax reporting purposes, and operated the business as a sole proprietorship from 2009 to 2012, at which time taxpayer converted the business to a limited liability company (LLC), and where taxpayer failed to update the business’s registration with the department and continued to operate under the original CRS number assigned to the sole proprietorship, and where the department’s computerized auditing system detected a mismatch between the information taxpayer reported to the IRS and the information taxpayer reported to the department, resulting in 
the department updating the computerized records to reflect that taxpayer’s business was operating as an LLC, but failing to issue taxpayer a new CRS number, and where, in 2017, the department issued a notice of assessment of taxes and demand for payment for gross receipts tax from taxpayer as the sole proprietor of the business for the 2012 tax year, and where the hearing officer denied taxpayer’s protest finding that the sole proprietorship was obligated for the assessment because at the time the tax liability was incurred, the CRS number on file with the department was assigned to taxpayer, as the sole proprietor of the business, rather than as an LLC, the hearing officer erred in denying taxpayer’s protest because to the extent the hearing officer’s decision imposed liability against taxpayer for failing to register with the department, it is not in accordance with this section, which permits only the person engaging in business to be taxed, and the overwhelming evidence demonstrated that the business was operating as an LLC during the taxable period.  Moreover, neither the registration statute, NMSA 1978 § 7-1-12, nor the department’s regulations permit the department to impose liability against a taxpayer based solely on its failure to update its registrations.  New Mexico Depo v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep't, 2021-NMCA-011. 
Legal incidence of gross receipts tax on seller. — The statutory language of 7-9-3F NMSA 1978 and this section places the legal incidence of the gross receipts tax on the seller. United States v. New Mexico, 581 F.2d 803 (10th Cir. 1978), aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).  
Incidence of tax on contractors selling services to United States. — The legal incidence of the gross receipts tax was on contractors as sellers of services to the United States, not on the federal government. United States v. New Mexico, 581 F.2d 803 (10th Cir. 1978), aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).  
Tax valid since contractors not agents of United States. — Since contracts did not authorize contractors to act as agents of the United States in purchasing supplies and materials, application of the gross receipts tax to the contractual transactions for materials and supplies was not unconstitutional. United States v. New Mexico, 581 F.2d 803 (10th Cir. 1978), aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).  
Tax valid even though increases government's contract costs. — That the gross receipts tax may increase cost on a contract to the government does not invalidate the tax on the grounds that a state may not directly tax the federal government since its legal incidence falls elsewhere. United States v. New Mexico, 581 F.2d 803 (10th Cir. 1978), aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).  
Agency exemption. — Money received by the taxpayer, a property management company, from the property owner as reimbursement for on-site employee expenses was not taxable as gross receipts, because the taxpayer was an agent for the property owner for the purpose of employing and paying the on-site employees employed at the owners property. Carlsberg Mgt. Co. v. State Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1993-NMCA-121, 116 N.M. 247, 861 P.2d 288, but see 7-9-3.5 NMSA 1978, which now excludes from tax receipts received solely on behalf of another in a disclosed agency capacity.  
If bank can pass tax on, it is not real taxpayer. — Since services of maintaining and processing other banks' accounts were not reasonably necessary or incidental to business or functions of national banking association, New Mexico was not prevented by federal law from levying gross receipts tax on association's receipts collected for said services and association could pass tax on to banks for which it performed services and was therefore not the real taxpayer. First Nat'l Bank v. Commissioner of Revenue, 1969-NMCA-090, 80 N.M. 699, 460 P.2d 64, cert. denied, 80 N.M. 707, 460 P.2d 72, appeal dismissed, 397 U.S. 661, 90 S. Ct. 1407, 25 L. Ed. 2d 643 (1970).  
Gross receipts tax may be constitutionally imposed on contractor doing work on Indian reservation in the state if there is no imposition on the sovereignty of the United States or infringement of the Indian tribe's right to self-government. Tiffany Constr. Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1981-NMSC-057, 96 N.M. 296, 629 P.2d 1225.  
Gross receipts tax upon non-Indians working on reservations valid. — When the gross receipts tax levied upon non-Indians working on state reservations is nondiscriminatory and does not preclude a possible similar tax by a tribe on activities conducted on its reservation, the Indian right to self-government is not impaired and the tax is valid. Mescalero Apache Tribe v. O'Cheskey, 625 F.2d 967 (10th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 959, 101 S. Ct. 1417, 67 L. Ed. 2d 383 (1981), reh’g denied, 455 U.S. 929, 102 S. Ct. 1296, 71 L. Ed. 2d 474; 459 U.S. 1025, 103 S. Ct. 393, 74 L. Ed. 2d 522 (1982).  
If tax ultimately falls on tribal organization. — If the economic burden of the gross receipts tax ultimately falls on a tribal organization, even though the legal incidence of the tax falls on the non-Indian contractor with whom the organization contracted to build an Indian school, the imposition of the tax impermissibly impedes the clearly expressed federal interest in promoting the quality and quantity of educational opportunities for Indians by depleting the funds available for the construction of Indian schools. Ramah Navajo Sch. Bd., Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 458 U.S. 832, 102 S. Ct. 3394, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1174 (1982).  
Federal regulatory scheme and policy. — The comprehensive federal regulatory scheme and the express federal policy of encouraging tribal self-sufficiency in the area of education preclude the imposition of the state gross receipts tax on the construction of school facilities on tribal lands pursuant to a contract between a tribal organization and a non-Indian contracting firm. Ramah Navajo Sch. Bd., Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 458 U.S. 832, 102 S. Ct. 3394, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1174 (1982).  
Sale of cigarettes to non-Indians on Indian reservation. — Non-Indian did not have a valid agency relationship with an Indian, so as to bar the imposition of gross receipts taxes on the sale of cigarettes to non-Indians on an Indian reservation, since the Indian made no financial contribution to the commencement or operation of the business and all decision-making was in the hands of the taxpayer. Bien Mur Indian Mkt. Ctr., Inc. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1988-NMCA-104, 108 N.M. 355, 772 P.2d 885, rev’d on other grounds, 108 N.M. 228, 770 P.2d 873 (1989).  
Federal preemption for services rendered Indians. — District court properly ordered state tax agency to refund gross receipts taxes paid by a private contractor on services performed on an Indian reservation for a corporation owned by an Indian tribe, in light of the fact that the Indian trader statutes, 25 U.S.C. §§ 261-264 preempted the agency's authority to impose such a tax since the federal trader statutes included services under the scope of "trade". Laguna Indus., Inc. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1992-NMCA-109, 114 N.M. 644, 845 P.2d 167, aff'd sum nom. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't v. Laguna Indus., Inc., 1993-NMSC-025, 115 N.M. 553, 855 P.2d 127.  
Receipts from horse races not exempt. — The legislature, in enacting the Gross Receipts Tax Act, did not intend to exempt receipts from horse races. There is neither ambiguity nor doubt that the language used in the Gross Receipts Tax Act applies to the receipts of a horse owner paid to him for a winning purse and the receipts of a horse trainer paid to him as his percentage of a winning purse. Till v. Jones, 1972-NMCA-046, 83 N.M. 743, 497 P.2d 745, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 740, 497 P.2d 742. See Section 7-9-40 NMSA 1978 which now exempts receipts from horse race purses.  
Construction work incidental to "severing" not subject to receipts tax. — The exemption provided by 7-9-35 NMSA 1978 applied since "severing" was taking place as the development work was performed and none of taxpayer's work was preliminary to or preparatory for "severing"; therefore, receipts from development work, which includes construction, were exempted from the gross receipts tax and taxable under the service tax (resources excise tax) when such construction work was incidental to the "severing." Patten v. Bureau of Revenue, 1974-NMCA-051, 86 N.M. 355, 524 P.2d 527.  
Pawnbroker's receipts from sales of pawned chattel were not exempt or deductible from gross receipts tax as the recoupment of principal, interest, and handling charges attendant to the initial loan transaction. Wing Pawn Shop v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1991-NMCA-024, 111 N.M. 735, 809 P.2d 649 (decided on facts existing prior to enactment of Pawnbrokers Act, 56-12-1 NMSA 1978 et seq.)  
Collection agencies gross receipts. — A collection agency does not include the creditor's portion of the proceeds, nor the taxes it collects on behalf of the creditor, in calculating its commission proceeds, i.e., its gross receipts. Rather, a collection agency pays gross receipts tax only on the commission portion of the debt. The total tax imposed on the debt and charged to the debtor is simply the sum of the creditor's tax and the agency's tax. Martinez v. Albuquerque Collection Servs., Inc., 867 F. Supp. 1495 (D.N.M. 1994).  
Nationwide school operating location in state. — Nationwide technical-vocational school operating a location in New Mexico is subject to the gross receipts tax; the taxable base includes tuition receipts from students in New Mexico for curriculum development, financial aid services, and job placement services. ITT Educ. Serv. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1998-NMCA-078, 125 N.M. 244, 959 P.2d 969.  
Fees of management service company. — Fees paid to a hospital management services company as reimbursement for salaries and expenses of management personnel provided by the company were subject to the gross receipts tax. Brim Healthcare, Inc. v. State Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1995-NMCA-055, 119 N.M. 818, 896 P.2d 498 (decided under prior law).  
III. OUT-OF-STATE. 
A substantial nexus was created through activities of a sister corporation. — Where taxpayer had no physical presence in New Mexico other than through stores in New Mexico owned by a sister corporation; and the sister corporation promoted taxpayer through sales of gift cards that were redeemable at taxpayer and that displayed taxpayer’s web address, shared customer’s email addresses with taxpayer, sold memberships in a shared loyalty program that gave customers a discount on purchases from taxpayer, accepted returns from taxpayer’s customers in exchange for store credit which policy taxpayer advertised to its customers, and used the parent corporation’s trademark which taxpayer also used, the sister corporation’s activities in New Mexico on behalf of taxpayer were significantly associated with taxpayer’s ability to establish and maintain a market for its sales in New Mexico and were sufficient to create a substantial nexus between taxpayer and New Mexico which permitted New Mexico to impose the gross receipts tax on taxpayer’s sales to customers in New Mexico without offending the federal Commerce Clause. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep’t v. Barnesandnoble.com, L.L.C., 2013-NMSC-023, aff’g 2012-NMCA-063, 283 P.3d 298.  
Use of a trademark to establish a market in New Mexico creates a substantial nexus. — Where taxpayer was engaged in the business of selling books online; taxpayer did not own or lease property in New Mexico and did not have retail stores or sales agents or employees in New Mexico; taxpayer’s parent corporation had three bookstores in New Mexico that used the parent corporation’s trademark; taxpayer used the trademark on its website; and the stores sold gift cards that could be redeemed at the stores or through the taxpayer’s website and loyalty program memberships that entitled customers to discounts at the stores or through taxpayer’s website, taxpayer’s use of shared marketing, name recognition and trademarks established a market for taxpayer in New Mexico which created a substantial nexus between taxpayer and New Mexico sufficient to support the imposition of the gross receipts tax on taxpayer. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep’t v. Barnesandnoble.com, LLC, 2012-NMCA-063, 283 P.3d 298, cert. granted, 2012-NMCERT-006.  
Destination principle. — The destination principle, which taxes the sale or use of goods that cross state lines at their destination, applies to determine whether an interstate transaction is a taxable sale under the New Mexico gross receipts tax laws. Dell Catalog Sales, L.P. v. Taxation and Revenue Dept., 2009-NMCA-001, 145 N.M. 419, 199 P.3d 863, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-007, cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 1616, 173 L.Ed.2d 1030.  
Where the taxpayer sold computers by mail, telephone and internet orders from its facilities in Texas to New Mexico customers; the taxpayer did not own or lease property in New Mexico; the taxpayer did not have retail stores, sales agents or employees in New Mexico; title to the computers transferred from the taxpayer to the customer upon shipment from the taxpayer’s facility in Texas; and the taxpayer retained the risk of loss until delivery; and the computers were shipped by common carrier selected by the taxpayer, the taxpayer’s activities constituted taxable sales in New Mexico because the actual consumption and use of the computers occurred in New Mexico. Dell Catalog Sales, L.P. v. Taxation and Revenue Dept., 2009-NMCA-001, 145 N.M. 419, 199 P.3d 863, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-007, cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 1616, 173 L.Ed.2d 1030.  
Substantial nexus. — Where the taxpayer sold computers by mail, telephone, and internet orders from its facilities in Texas to New Mexico customers; the taxpayer did not own or lease property in New Mexico; the taxpayer did not have retail stores, sales agents or employees in New Mexico; the taxpayer contracted with a third party to provide in-home service repairs on the computers in New Mexico; and the non-sales activities of the third party in New Mexico were an important factor in establishing and maintaining a market for the taxpayer’s computers, the taxpayer had a substantial nexus with New Mexico and the imposition of gross receipts tax on the taxpayer did not violate the Commerce Clause. Dell Catalog Sales, L.P. v. Taxation and Revenue Dept., 2009-NMCA-001, 145 N.M. 419, 199 P.3d 863, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-007, cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 1616, 173 L.Ed.2d 1030.  
Mere contracts are not commerce at all, neither intrastate nor interstate. Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream Co. v. Revenue Div., 1979-NMCA-098, 93 N.M. 301, 599 P.2d 1098.  
Tax on items in interstate commerce to be fair and nondiscriminatory. — To be sustained against a claim that a state-imposed tax runs afoul of the commerce clause of the federal constitution, a tax upon items connected with interstate commerce must: (1) be applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing state; (2) be fairly apportioned; (3) not discriminate against interstate commerce; and (4) be fairly related to the services provided by the state. Pittsburgh & Midway Coal Mining Co. v. Revenue Div., 1983-NMCA-019, 99 N.M. 545, 660 P.2d 1027, appeal dismissed, 464 U.S. 923, 104 S. Ct. 323, 78 L. Ed. 2d 296 (1983).  
New Mexico may not tax income and gross receipts of Indians residing on a reservation when the income and gross receipts involved are derived solely from activities within the reservation. Hunt v. O'Cheskey, 1973-NMSC-068, 85 N.M. 388, 512 P.2d 961.  
Tax on gross receipts from sales in other states unconstitutional. — Tax levied on the gross receipts from the sales of tangible personal property in another state is an impermissible burden on commerce. Evco v. Jones, 409 U.S. 91, 93 S. Ct. 349, 34 L. Ed. 2d 325 (1972).  
Place services rendered. — To determine whether receipts from services are subject to gross receipts tax, the focus must be on what services the customers are contracting for and where those services are taking place. Simply because activity necessary to complete the services takes place out-of-state does not mean that the services provided are immune from New Mexico's gross receipts tax. Rauscher, Pierce, Refsnes, Inc. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2000-NMCA-065, 129 N.M. 404, 9 P.3d 648, aff’d 2002-NMSC-013, 132 N.M. 226, 46 P.3d 687.  
Tax incurred at point of retail sale. — Where utilities retail their electrical energy through interstate lines only to consumers in Arizona, for that reason they incur no liability to New Mexico for its gross receipts tax, which is incurred at the point of retail sale. Arizona v. New Mexico, 425 U.S. 794, 96 S. Ct. 1845, 48 L. Ed. 2d 376 (1976).  
Discrimination between broadcast and outdoor advertising held rational. — When regulations exempted broadcasting advertisement displayers in New Mexico from the tax imposed upon taxpayer (operator of a billboard service), there was discrimination in the treatment of these different media forms, but the burden was upon the taxpayer to negative every conceivable basis which might support the discriminatory classification, because of the implied rational basis underlying every tax statute, i.e., that the state has the right, power and duty to raise the necessary funds for its public purposes, and it was held that there was a rational basis for the state to discriminate between the broadcast industry and the outdoor advertising industry in the taxation of displays of national messages. Markham Adver. Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-071, 88 N.M. 176, 538 P.2d 1198, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 318, 540 P.2d 248.  
Since broadcasters generally engage in interstate transmission of their messages, and even if broadcasts by smaller stations might not always cross interstate lines, yet the potential exists for radio and television waves to deliver transitory, interstate communications, for this reason, national advertising by local broadcasting stations has long been held exempt from state taxation. Markham Adver. Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-071, 88 N.M. 176, 538 P.2d 1198, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 318, 540 P.2d 248.  
While billboard advertising takes place only in state. — Taxpayer's service of posting messages for national companies on billboards located in New Mexico was being taxed for displaying an activity taking place only in this state and not for advertising; thus it was intrastate in character, and the gross receipts tax imposed on it did not constitute an undue burden on interstate commerce in violation of the federal constitution. Markham Adver. Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-071, 88 N.M. 176, 538 P.2d 1198, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 318, 540 P.2d 248.  
If multiple taxation shown, tax would likely be unconstitutional. — The activities of taxpayer, situated and performing services (posting billboards) in New Mexico, were not within the taxing authority of any other state, and therefore no multiple taxation was possible; the instant tax could be declared invalid upon a showing by the taxpayer that multiple taxation would be likely to result and would be likely to unduly burden interstate 
commerce, but neither showing was made, and therefore, no basis was demonstrated upon which a claim of potential multiple taxation as to this taxpayer could be found. Markham Adver. Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-071, 88 N.M. 176, 538 P.2d 1198, cert. denied, 88 N.M. 318, 540 P.2d 248.  
Traffic between states absent in franchise agreement. — If none of the "activities" of the franchise agreement are serviced by mail, telephone correspondence or by any employees of taxpayer, no intercourse or traffic between this state and another is found. Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream Co. v. Revenue Div., 1979-NMCA-098, 93 N.M. 301, 599 P.2d 1098.  
Tax constitutional on coal sales to out-of-state buyers. — The imposition of gross receipt taxes on proceeds from the sales of coal to out-of-state buyers does not impermissibly interfere with the commerce clause of the federal constitution. Pittsburgh & Midway Coal Mining Co. v. Revenue Div., 1983-NMCA-019, 99 N.M. 545, 660 P.2d 1027, appeal dismissed, 464 U.S. 923, 104 S. Ct. 323, 78 L. Ed. 2d 296.  
Tax applicable to foreign franchisor. — Because franchisor has no payroll, real property, personnel or offices located in this state, but it does furnish signs which must be leased or purchased by its dealers, its sales of tangible property and its granting of exclusive franchises constitute engaging in intrastate business in this state, and the franchise fees received therefrom are subject to the gross receipts tax. AAMCO Transmissions v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1979-NMCA-092, 93 N.M. 389, 600 P.2d 841, cert. denied, 93 N.M. 205, 598 P.2d 1165 (superceded by statute, Sonic Indus., Inc. v. State, 2000-NMCA-087, 129 N.M. 657, 11 P.3d 1219).  
Tax applicable to franchise fees. — The imposition of gross receipts tax on franchise fees received from this state's dealers does not violate the due process clause or commerce clause and is proper since the franchisor is in the business of selling franchises, developing and marketing parts, receiving its primary source of income from the sale of franchises, collecting a percentage of franchisee's gross receipts as a lease payment for use of the trademark and trade name and where its leased trademarks and trade names and their businesses are protected by the laws of this state; thus, franchisor is engaged in business in this state. AAMCO Transmissions v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1979-NMCA-092, 93 N.M. 389, 600 P.2d 841, cert. denied, 93 N.M. 205, 598 P.2d 1165 (superceded by statute, Sonic Indus., Inc. v. State, 2000-NMCA-087, 129 N.M. 657, 11 P.3d 1219).  
Foreign corporation's opinions sent to foreign clients not taxable. — Opinions by an Oklahoma corporation concerning subsurface geological formations of the earth's crust beneath New Mexico delivered to clients in Oklahoma and other states were not in intrastate commerce in New Mexico and the income from such opinions was not taxable in New Mexico. Seismograph Serv. Corp. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1956-NMSC-028, 61 N.M. 16, 293 P.2d 977.

ANNOTATIONS 
Compiler's notes. — Laws 1991, ch. 8, § 2 enacted this section as 7-9-4.1 NMSA 1978, but, since a section with that code number had already been enacted, this section was compiled as 7-9-4.3 NMSA 1978.  
The 2019 amendment, effective July 1, 2019, excluded hospitals from "entities licensed by the department of health" that are exempt from paying governmental gross receipts tax; and after "department of health", added "other than a hospital". 
The 1993 amendment, effective July 1, 1993, inserted "school district and any" in the first sentence.  
Laws 1993, ch. 332, § 1 enacted identical amendments to this section. The section was set out as amended by Laws 1993, ch. 352, § 1. See 12-1-8 NMSA 1978.

7-9-5. Presumption of taxability. 
A. To prevent evasion of the gross receipts tax and to aid in its administration, it is presumed that all receipts of a person engaging in business are subject to the gross receipts tax.  A person engaged solely in transactions specifically exempt under the provisions of the Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax Act shall not be required to register or file a return under that act. 
B. If receipts from nontaxable charges for mobile telecommunications services are aggregated with and not separately stated from taxable charges for mobile telecommunications services, the charges for nontaxable mobile telecommunications services shall be subject to gross receipts tax unless the home service provider can reasonably identify nontaxable charges in its books and records that are kept in the regular course of business.  For the purposes of this subsection, "charges for mobile telecommunications services", "home service provider" and "mobile telecommunications services" have the meanings given in the federal Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act. 
C. A marketplace provider engaging in business in this state is not liable for amounts of gross receipts tax collected incorrectly due to the marketplace provider reasonably relying on erroneous information provided by the seller.  
History: 1953 Comp., § 72-16A-5, enacted by Laws 1966, ch. 47, § 5; 2002, ch. 18, § 3; 2019, ch. 270, § 28.

Taxpayer must prove deduction proper. — Any assessment of taxes by the taxation and revenue department is presumed to be correct and, in protesting the assessment of taxes, taxpayer has the burden of proving the deductions were proper. In reviewing, courts will reverse the department's decision only if it is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, otherwise not in accordance with law, or not supported by substantial evidence.

Gross receipts to owner and trainer from horse races taxable. — The legislature, in enacting the Gross Receipts Tax Act, did not intend to exempt receipts from horse races. There is neither ambiguity nor doubt that the language used in the Gross Receipts Tax Act applies to the receipts of a horse owner paid to him for a winning purse and the receipts of a horse trainer paid to him as his percentage of a winning purse. Till v. Jones, 1972-NMCA-046, 83 N.M. 743, 497 P.2d 745, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 740, 497 P.2d 742. See Section 7-9-40 NMSA 1978 which now exempts receipts from horse race purses.  
Application of presumption. — A hearing officer's interpretation of the term "broker" and the court of appeals' affirmance of that interpretation is viewed in light of the presumption that "all receipts of a person engaging in business are subject to the gross receipts tax" under the provisions of this section. Rauscher, Pierce, Refsnes, Inc. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 2002-NMSC-013, 132 N.M. 226, 46 P.3d 687.

B. When the gross receipts tax is stated separately on the books of the seller or lessor, and if the total amount of tax that is stated separately on transactions reportable within one reporting period is in excess of the amount of gross receipts tax otherwise payable on the transactions on which the tax was stated separately, the excess amount of tax stated on the transactions within that reporting period shall be included in gross receipts.

(1) manufactured by the person using the property in the state; or 
(2) acquired in a transaction for which the seller's receipts were not subject to the gross receipts tax. 
B. For the purpose of Subsection A of this section, value of tangible personal property shall be the adjusted basis of the property for federal income tax purposes determined as of the time of acquisition or introduction into this state or of conversion of the property to taxable use, whichever is later.  If no adjusted basis for federal income tax purposes is established for the property, a reasonable value of the property shall be used. 
C. For the privilege of making taxable use of a license or franchise in New Mexico, there is imposed on the person using the license or franchise an excise tax equal to the rate provided in Subsection A or G of this section, as applicable, against the value of the license or franchise in its use in this state.  The department by rule, ruling or instruction shall fairly apportion, where appropriate, the value of a license or franchise to its value in use in New Mexico.  The tax shall apply only to the value of a license or franchise used in New Mexico where the license or franchise was acquired in a transaction the receipts from which were not subject to the gross receipts tax. 
D. For the privilege of making taxable use of services in New Mexico, there is imposed on the person using the services an excise tax equal to the rate provided in Subsection A or G of this section, as applicable, against the value of the services at the time the services were performed or the product of the service was acquired.  For use of services to be a taxable use pursuant to this subsection, the services shall have been acquired in a transaction the receipts from which were not subject to the gross receipts tax. 
E. For purposes of this section, receipts are not subject to the gross receipts tax if the person responsible for the gross receipts tax on those receipts lacked nexus in New Mexico or the receipts were exempt or allowed to be deducted pursuant to the Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax Act. 
F. The tax imposed by this section shall be referred to as the "compensating tax". 
G. If the gross receipts tax is increased to five and one-eighth percent pursuant to Subsection C of Section 7-9-4 NMSA 1978, the rate of the compensating tax shall be five and one-eighth percent. 
H. As used in this section, "taxable use" means use by a person who acquires tangible personal property, a license, a franchise or a service, and the use of which would not have qualified for an exemption or deduction pursuant to the Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax Act.

Distribution of sales catalogues. — Where the taxpayer sold computers by mail, telephone, and internet orders from its facilities in Texas to New Mexico customers; the taxpayer created, printed and prepared catalogues outside New Mexico and mailed the catalogues from outside New Mexico to potential New Mexico customers; and the taxpayer retained the right to determine where and how the catalogues were distributed in New Mexico, the taxpayer’s distribution of sales catalogues in New Mexico constituted a use of the catalogues in New Mexico and was subject to the compensating tax. Dell Catalog Sales, L.P. v. Taxation and Revenue Dept., 2009-NMCA-001, 145 N.M. 419, 199 P.3d 863, cert. denied, 2008-NMCERT-007, cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 1616, 173 L.Ed.2d 1030.  
The use or compensating tax is an excise tax and not an ad valorem tax. Robert E. McKee, Gen. Contractor Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1957-NMSC-082, 63 N.M. 185, 315 P.2d 832 (decided under former law).  
Any reasonable tax classification constitutional. — It is for the legislature to adopt classifications for the imposition of excise taxes as it may deem proper and any reasonable classification cannot be held to deny equal protection or due process. 
Edmunds v. Bureau of Revenue, 1958-NMSC-112, 64 N.M. 454, 330 P.2d 131 (decided under former law).  
"Compensating tax" and nontaxable transaction certificates. — This section is designed to impose a compensating tax on transactions such as one which initially would have been subject to the gross receipts tax were it not for the delivery of the nontaxable transaction certificates by the buyer of the materials or services pursuant to Sections 7-9-51 or 7-9-52 NMSA 1978. Continental Inn of Albuquerque, Inc. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1992-NMCA-030, 113 N.M. 588, 829 P.2d 946.  
Use of nontaxable transaction certificates. — The use of nontaxable transaction certificates, not the taking of the deduction, subjects a taxpayer to the compensating tax. Continental Inn of Albuquerque, Inc. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1992-NMCA-030, 113 N.M. 588, 829 P.2d 946.  
Intangible property not subject to tax. — Laws 1993, Chapter 31, § 2 amended the definition of property in compensating tax provisions so that it does not include intangible property. Kmart Corp. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't., 2006-NMSC-006, 139 N.M. 172, 131 P.3d 22  
Foreign transaction subject to tax if receipts tax would apply to domestic. — Supreme court, although finding no need to interpret this section in the disposition of the case before it, indicated that this section appeared to impose a compensating or use tax on property acquired out-of-state in an isolated transaction and used in New Mexico only where the transaction would have been subject to a gross receipts tax if the transaction had taken place in New Mexico. Union Cnty. Feedlot, Inc. v. Vigil, 1968-NMCA-088, 79 N.M. 684, 448 P.2d 485.  
Tax applicable to reimbursements for property used under government contracts. — Application of the compensating tax to reimbursements for property purchased out-of-state and brought into New Mexico for use under government contracts was valid. United States v. New Mexico, 581 F.2d 803 (10th Cir. 1978), aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).  
Transportation costs excluded from sales price when paid by buyer. — Under a regulation promulgated by the bureau (now department), in computing the compensating tax, transportation costs should be excluded from the sales price of the property when paid to the carrier by the buyer. Thus, when, under the sales contract between the taxpayer (manufacturer) and the buyer, an agency relationship existed whereby the taxpayer was authorized to pay transportation charges both on materials sold to the buyer and on materials returned by it for credit or repair, the regulation specifically excluded from the sales price of the property the transportation costs, which were paid to the carrier by the buyer, since the buyer reimbursed the manufacturer for transportation costs. Western Elec. Co. v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1976-NMCA-047, 90 N.M. 164, 561 P.2d 26.  
Effect of buyer's voluntary payment of tax. — A corporation engaged in the business of selling property in New Mexico was liable for payment of the state's gross receipts tax on the receipts of sales. The voluntary payment of compensating tax by the buyer did not relieve the seller of liability for the gross receipts tax otherwise collectible. Proficient Food Co. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1988-NMCA-042, 107 N.M. 392, 758 P.2d 806, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 308, 756 P.2d 1203.  
Contractor furnishing purchased materials to federal government liable for tax. — Since general contractor was required by contracts with federal government to furnish materials to be used on federal reservation in New Mexico, the contractor purchased the materials, became the owner thereof, and was liable for the use or compensating tax under § 72-17-1, 1953 Comp. et seq. (now repealed); and this was not taxation of government land or other government property. Robert E. McKee, Gen. Contractor, Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1957-NMSC-082, 63 N.M. 185, 315 P.2d 832.  
Existence of promissory note does not make sale executory. — When purchase agreement was entered into out-of-state whereby purchaser would pay a deposit and make a promissory note for the balance, the agreement was not an executory document and failure to make any of the subsequent payments after the deposit did not render it executory. Therefore, the use of the article purchased was taxable pursuant to Subsection A(2). Garfield Mines, Ltd. v. O'Cheskey, 1973-NMCA-128, 85 N.M. 547, 514 P.2d 304.  
Distribution of advertising materials. — New Mexico retailer who contracted with out-of-state advertising coordinators, but exercised control over its distribution contractors in New Mexico, "used" advertising materials distributed in the state within the meaning of this section.

ANNOTATIONS 
The 2019 amendment, effective July 1, 2019, prohibited the department from taking action to enforce collection of gross receipts tax with respect to certain tax liabilities, and removed provisions related to the prohibition of taking action to enforce the collection of compensating tax with respect to certain tax liabilities; in the section heading, deleted "compensating"; and deleted former Subsections A and B and added the introductory clause and new Subsections A and B. 
7-9-7.2. Authority to establish standards for certified service providers. 
A. The secretary is authorized to provide information, upon which taxpayers may rely, as to the taxability of gross receipts from particular transactions, including taxability matrices, and is further authorized to establish standards for the certification of certified service providers that offer software-based systems to enable taxpayers to properly determine the taxability of gross receipts from particular transactions.

7-9-8. Presumption of taxability and value. 
A. To prevent evasion of the compensating tax and the duty to collect it, it is presumed that property bought or sold by any person for delivery into this state is bought or sold for a taxable use in this state.  
B. In determining the amount of compensating tax due on the use of property, it is presumed, in the absence of preponderant evidence of another value, that the value means the total amount of money or the reasonable value of other consideration paid for property exclusive of any type of time-price differential. However, in an exchange in which the amount of money paid does not represent the value of the property or property and service purchased, the compensating tax shall be imposed on the reasonable value of the property or property and service purchased.  
C. In determining the amount of compensating tax due on the use of a service, it is presumed, in the absence of preponderant evidence of another value, that the value means the total amount of money or the reasonable value of other consideration paid for the service exclusive of any type of time-price differential. However, in an exchange in which the amount paid does not represent the value of the service purchased, the compensating tax shall be imposed on the reasonable value of the service purchased.

ANNOTATIONS 
The 1990 amendment, effective July 1, 1990, substituted "department" for "division" at the end of the section and made a minor stylistic change.  
Due process not violated by actions of tax officials. — Department did not violate taxpayer's right to due process by: (1) making an assessment before the taxpayer provided pertinent records; (2) targeting the taxpayer because it had no history of reporting compensating taxes; and (3) delaying 18 months from the time of an audit notice to the time of the field audit. Vivigen, Inc. v. Minzner, 1994-NMCA-027, 117 N.M. 224, 870 P.2d 1382.  
No offset for prior years investment credits. — A taxpayer was not entitled to an offset in the amount it owed for compensating taxes for investment credits it had made in previous years, because it had not claimed the credits within the one-year statute of limitations period. Although the taxpayer argued that it was entitled to an offset under the doctrine of equitable recoupment, a taxpayer is not entitled to seek a credit after the statute-of-limitations period has expired unless the state is imposing a tax on the same taxable event on a ground that is inconsistent with the original payment by the taxpayer. Vivigen, Inc. v. Minzner, 1994-NMCA-027, 117 N.M. 224, 870 P.2d 1382.  
7-9-10. Agents for collection of compensating tax; duties. 
A. Every person carrying on or causing to be carried on any activity within this state attempting to exploit New Mexico's markets who sells property or sells property and service for use in this state and who is not subject to the gross receipts tax on receipts

"Activity", for the purposes of this section, does not include having a world wide web site as a third-party provider on a computer physically located in New Mexico but owned by another nonaffiliated person, and "activity" does not include using a nonaffiliated third-party call center to accept and process telephone or electronic orders of tangible personal property or licenses primarily from non-New Mexico buyers, which orders are forwarded to a location outside New Mexico for filling, or to provide services primarily to non-New Mexico customers.  
B. To ensure orderly and efficient collection of the public revenue, if any application of this section is held invalid, the section's application to other situations or persons shall not be affected.

Inequalities which result from singling out of one particular class for taxation or exemption, infringe no constitutional limitation. Dikewood Corp. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1964-NMSC-057, 74 N.M. 75, 390 P.2d 661.  
Statute of exemption from taxation must receive a strict construction, and no claim of exemption should be sustained unless within the express letter or the necessary scope of the exempting clause. Robert E. McKee, Gen. Contractor, Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1957-NMSC-082, 63 N.M. 185, 315 P.2d 832 (decided under former law).  
Legal services performed for Indian tribe. — The gross receipts tax may properly be imposed on a non-Indian law firm for legal services performed off the reservation on behalf of an Indian tribe; federal law cannot preempt by implication the tax under such circumstances, since, when reviewing state taxation of activities of non-Indians off the reservation, an actual conflict with an express federal provision is required for preemption. Rodey, Dickason, Sloan, Akin & Robb, P.A. v. Revenue Div., Dep't of Taxation & Revenue, 1988-NMSC-063, 107 N.M. 399, 759 P.2d 186.  
Uncontemplated regulatory exception invalid. — If a regulation adopted by the bureau of revenue (now taxation and revenue department) creates an exception from exempt transactions which is not contemplated by the legislative act, even though such administrative interpretations are entitled to great weight in ascertaining the meaning of the statute, the courts may not give legal sanction to the agency's incorrect construction 
of unambiguous statutory language. Strebeck Props., Inc. v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1979-NMCA-035, 93 N.M. 262, 599 P.2d 1059.  
Burden rests squarely on taxpayer to prove entitlement to exemption. Al Zuni Traders v. Bureau of Revenue, 1977-NMCA-025, 90 N.M. 258, 561 P.2d 1351.  
Notice of type of proof necessary to avoid taxation unnecessary. — Under the Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax Act, the contention that prior to the first audit of its books the commissioner had not sent any notice to taxpayer, or other taxpayers in the same industry, of the type of proof necessary to avoid taxation was pure nonsense. Al Zuni Traders v. Bureau of Revenue, 1977-NMCA-025, 90 N.M. 258, 561 P.2d 1351.  
Legislature intended to make gross receipts and compensating taxes correlate: an exemption from the gross receipts tax must also be treated as an exemption from the compensating tax. Western Elec. Co. v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1976-NMCA-047, 90 N.M. 164, 561 P.2d 26.

Nontaxable transaction certificates shall contain the information and be in a form prescribed by the department. The department by regulation may deem to be nontaxable transaction certificates documents issued by other states or the multistate tax commission to taxpayers not required to be registered in New Mexico.

If the seller or lessor has been given an identification number for tax purposes by the department, the seller or lessor shall disclose that identification number to the buyer or lessee prior to or upon acceptance of a nontaxable transaction certificate.  
B. Except as provided in Subsection C of this section, a person who does not comply with Subsection A of this section may establish entitlement to a deduction from gross receipts by presenting alternative evidence that demonstrates the facts necessary 
to support entitlement to the deduction, but the burden of proof is on that person. Alternative evidence includes:  
(1) invoices or contracts that identify the nature of the transaction;  
(2) documentation as to the purchaser's use or disposition of the property or service;  
(3) a statement from the purchaser indicating that the purchaser sold or intends to resell the property or service purchased from the seller, either by itself or in combination with other property or services, in the ordinary course of business. The statement from the purchaser shall include:

(b) the date of the invoice or date of the transaction;  
(c) the invoice number or a copy of the invoice;  
(d) a copy of the purchase order, if available;

D. When a person accepts in good faith a properly executed nontaxable transaction certificate from the purchaser, the properly executed nontaxable transaction certificate shall be conclusive evidence that the proceeds from the transaction are deductible from the person's gross receipts.  
E. To exercise the privilege of executing appropriate nontaxable transaction certificates, a buyer or lessee shall apply to the department for permission to execute nontaxable transaction certificates, except with respect to documents issued by other states or the multistate tax commission that the department has deemed to be nontaxable transaction certificates.  
F. If a person has accepted in good faith a properly executed nontaxable transaction certificate, but the purchaser has not employed the property or service purchased in the nontaxable manner or has provided materially false or inaccurate 
information on the nontaxable transaction certificate, the purchaser shall be liable for an amount equal to any tax, penalty and interest that the seller would have been required to pay if the seller had not complied with Subsection A of this section.  
G. Any person who knowingly or willfully provides false or inaccurate information on a nontaxable transaction certificate or as alternative evidence provided in support of a claim for a deduction may be subject to prosecution under Sections 7-1-72 and 7-1-73 NMSA 1978.

Taxpayer not liable if certificates incorrectly issued. — Although receipts from transactions involving telephone service to schools, churches, police departments, fire departments and the like were not properly deductible in the first instance because the transactions were not sales of tangible personal property, nevertheless, when the telephone company accepted the nontaxable transaction certificates in compliance with this section, the deductions authorized thereby applied and protected the company from tax liability on receipts from those transactions, regardless of the propriety or impropriety of the certificates' issuance. Leaco Rural Tel. Coop., Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1974-NMCA-076, 86 N.M. 629, 526 P.2d 426.  
Reliance on certificates improper following change in law. — This section protects a taxpayer when the purchaser who provided the nontaxable transaction certificates (NTTC) has failed to live up to the promise that the actual transaction was nontaxable. However, it does not protect taxpayers from changes in the law that render formerly nontaxable transactions taxable. Indeed, a taxpayer has an affirmative duty to keep informed about changes in the tax law affecting liability and cannot escape tax liability for transactions based on NTTCs issued before a change in the law rendered the NTTCs invalid for those transactions. Arco Materials, Inc. v. State Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1994-NMCA-062, 118 N.M. 12, 878 P.2d 330, rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Blaze Constr. Co. v.

Certificate inapplicable to in-state ambulance receipts. — A nontaxable transaction certificate accepted by a taxpayer who will make initial use of the product or service outside of this state does not apply to receipts from the taxpayer's in-state ambulance service. McKinley Ambulance Serv. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1979-NMCA-026, 92 N.M. 599, 592 P.2d 515.

Entitlement to manufacturing deduction not found. — A biotechnology company whose expertise was in the diagnosis of genetic disorders that could be detected through the appearance of chromosomes, and who produced tangible objects that were 
provided to its customers, such as a written report of its experts' diagnosis and a laminated karyotype, which consisted of photographs of chromosomes that were numbered and pasted onto a piece of laminated cardboard, did not establish its entitlement to a manufacturing deduction, since the company could not identify any out-of-state purchases that would be subject to the compensating tax of products incorporated into its reports or laminated karyotypes. The department, whose assessment is assumed correct, had identified as subject to the compensating tax such items as microscopes, sinks, and furniture, which undoubtedly were not incorporated into the documents or laminated karyotypes.

Ordinary course of business. — Where taxpayer, whose typical business practices included owning, operating, leasing, and controlling generating plants and facilities for the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity to the public at retail, purchased turbines and related equipment to be used in the construction of a generating plant that would be conveyed to a municipality as an industrial revenue bond project, the sale of the turbines and related equipment was not in the taxpayer’s ordinary course of business because the taxpayer had not previously purchased turbines and related equipment and did not plan to do so in the future, the taxpayer had not previously constructed generating plants, and there was no evidence that the transaction at issue was typical or customary within the taxpayer’s industry. Pub. Serv. Co. of N.M. v. NM Taxation & Revenue Dept., 2007-NMCA-050, 141 N.M. 520, 157 P.3d 85.  
The phrase "ordinary course of business" contemplates some evidence that a transaction is customary, normal, or regular within the company’s own business or within the relevant industry at large. Pub. Serv. Co. of N.M. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dept., 2007-NMCA-050, 141 N.M. 520, 157 P.3d 85.  
Legislature possesses great freedom of classification in taxation field. — In the field of taxation, more than in other fields, the legislature possesses the greatest freedom in classification, and to attack such a classification as a violation of U.S. Const., amend. XIV places the burden on the one attacking to negative every conceivable basis which might support the classification and unless the classification is clearly arbitrary and capricious or void for uncertainty, the appellate court cannot substitute its views in selecting and classifying for those of the legislature. N.M. Newspapers, Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1971-NMCA-022, 82 N.M. 436, 483 P.2d 317 (Ct. App. 1971).  
Scope of authority. — Commissioner (now secretary) has authority to issue regulations interpreting and exemplifying statutes concerning the possession of nontaxable transaction certificates and he also has such authority as may be fairly implied from the statutory authorization. This authority, however, does not extend to imposing a time requirement which would abridge or modify the deduction authorized by the legislature. Rainbo Baking Co. v. Comm'r of Revenue, 1972-NMCA-139, 84 N.M. 303, 502 P.2d 406.  
Certificate required. — Since there was no evidence that contractors provided "nontaxable transaction certificates" to their vendors when they purchased property to be used in fulfilling their government contracts, the technical requirements of this section were not met. United States v. New Mexico, 581 F.2d 803 (10th Cir. 1978), aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).  
Form of certificate. — A seller's failure to possess a non-taxable transaction certificate in the form prescribed by the department and to procedurally present the form in a timely and proper manner provided a valid basis for denying the deductions claimed. A "blanket exemption certificate," issued by the buyer and relied upon by the seller, failed to meet this section's requirements. Proficient Food Co. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1988-NMCA-042, 107 N.M. 392, 758 P.2d 806, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 308, 756 P2d 1203.  
Reimbursement for services not sale. — Reimbursements for materials and supplies consumed in performing services under certain government contracts were merely reimbursements for those services and did not involve a sale by the contractors of tangible personal property to the United States nor qualify for a deduction under this section. United States v. New Mexico, 581 F.2d 803 (10th Cir. 1978), aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).

Construction services exempt from tax. — A decision of the commissioner of the bureau of revenue (now secretary of the taxation and revenue department) denying the exemption of the sale of construction services from the gross receipts tax is contrary to the law of this state providing an exemption for construction services.

Proper issuance of nontaxable transaction certificate. — The deduction from gross receipts pursuant to Section 7-9-51 NMSA 1978 and this section is not conditioned 
upon proper issuance of the nontaxable transaction certificates (NTTC) by the buyer. The determination of whether a NTTC has been properly issued is a matter between the department and the buyer. Continental Inn of Albuquerque, Inc. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1992-NMCA-030, 113 N.M. 588, 829 P.2d 946.  
Message to seller that seller is entitled to deductions. — The timely delivery of a nontaxable transaction certificate (NTTC) from the buyer to the seller conveys a message to the seller that the use of the NTTC's is such that the seller is entitled to deductions under Section 7-9-51 NMSA 1978 or this section when taxpayer issued NTTC's to the subcontractors; taxpayer, in essence, represented to the subcontractors that the use of the NTTC's was such that the subcontractors were entitled to deductions from the gross receipts tax. Continental Inn of Albuquerque, Inc. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1992-NMCA-030, 113 N.M. 588, 829 P.2d 946.

Contract for correctional services not a lease. — Where a contract for correctional services provided that the contractor was paid based on the number of inmates housed 
and that the contractor had the right to fill up unoccupied space with inmates from other jurisdictions, the contract was not a lease for real property. Corrections Corp. of Am. v. State of N.M., 2007-NMCA-148, 142 N.M. 779, 170 P.3d 1017.  
Receipts attributable to improvements. — Real estate developer was not entitled to deduction for receipts from the sale of real estate attributable to improvements made on the land since those improvements were completed prior to the effective date of this section but sale was not made until after effective date, as the plain language of this section shows a legislative intent not to allow a deduction on receipts from sale of real property attributable to such improvements.

Monies not received from lease of real property. — The receipts, which this section declares not to be "receipts from leasing real property," are clearly intended to mean the monies or rentals normally received by operators of hotels, motels, etc., when being operated as such in their customary and ordinary manner, from the lodgers, guests, roomers and occupants thereof. Chavez v. Commissioner of Revenue, 1970-NMCA-116, 82 N.M. 97, 476 P.2d 67.  
"Lease" not "license". — An arrangement between the owner of several properties used as bingo halls and the non-profit organizations who operated the bingo games was a lease and not a license where the organizations were required to pay rent, they were granted exclusive possession of certain facilities on the premises and the use of the facilities at certain times, and the owner could not revoke the agreement at will; although the arrangement was not a typical lease, restrictions in the Bingo and Raffle Act [repealed] accounted for the type of arrangement created and to deny that this was a lease would have made it impossible for bingo operators to enter arrangements that would qualify as leases. Quantum Corp. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1998-NMCA-050, 125 N.M. 49, 956 P.2d 848.  
"License" not "lease". — The buy-down contract payments were reimbursements to the taxpayer for her sales loss incurred as a result of engaging in the discount promotions and where the shelf-display contract receipts were taxable pursuant to this section because those contracts bore a much greater resemblance to a license than to the creation and conveyance of an interest in real property that would have constituted a lease.

Yearly lease of motel. — Since taxpayers leased motel to a railway on an annual basis at a fixed rental, having no relationship to whether the railway company let the rooms to lodgers, guests or roomers, the rental received by the taxpayer was not income received from lodgers, guests or roomers, but was income by way of rental received from the lessee railway for the entire premises, and was deductible from gross receipts.

A. Receipts from selling tangible personal property, or from selling licenses to use digital goods for the purpose of loaning those digital goods to the public, to the United States or to New Mexico or a governmental unit, subdivision, agency, department or instrumentality thereof may be deducted from gross receipts or from governmental gross receipts.

C. When a seller, in good faith, deducts receipts for tangible personal property or licenses to use digital goods for the purpose of loaning those digital goods to the public sold to the state or a governmental unit, subdivision, agency, department or instrumentality thereof, after receiving written assurances from the buyer's 
representative that the property sold is not construction material, the department shall not assert in a later assessment or audit of the seller that the receipts are not deductible pursuant to Paragraph (3) of Subsection A of this section.  
History: 1953 Comp., § 72-16A-14.9, enacted by Laws 1969, ch. 144, § 44; 1976, ch. 25, § 2; 1985, ch. 225, § 4; 1989, ch. 115, § 5; 1992, ch. 100, § 7; 1993, ch. 31, § 11; 1995, ch. 50, § 3; 2000, ch. 84, § 5; 2000, ch. 98, § 3; 2001, ch. 343, § 5; 2003, ch. 272, § 6; 2003, ch. 330, § 2; 2018, ch. 58, § 1; 2023, ch. 85, § 15.  
ANNOTATIONS

Laws 2003, ch. 272, § 6, effective July 1, 2003, in Subsection A, deleted "or" preceding "subdivision, agency"; and in Paragraph A(4), substituted "Subsection M" for "Subsection K".  
The 2001 amendment, effective July 1, 2001, substituted "construction material" for "tangible personal property that will become an ingredient or component part of a construction project" in Paragraph A(3); and added Subsection C.  
The 2000 amendment, effective March 7, 2000, inserted "for any purpose" following "personal property" in Subsection B.  
The 1995 amendment, effective July 1, 1995, inserted "tax" following "governmental gross receipts" in the section heading, deleted "nonfissionable" preceding "metalliferous" in Paragraph C(1), and made a minor stylistic change.  
The 1993 amendment, effective July 1, 1993, deleted "or any agency or instrumentality thereof" following "United States" and substituted "any governmental unit or subdivision, agency, department or instumentality" for "any political subdivision" in Subsection A, and deleted "the governing body of" following "personal property to" and substituted "nation or pueblo or any governmental subdivision, agency, department or instrumentality thereof" for "or Indian pueblo" in Subsection B.  
The 1992 amendment, effective July 1, 1992, inserted "governmental gross receipts" in the section heading; added "or from governmental gross receipts" at the end of Subsections A and B; substituted "that" for "which" in Subsection C(2); and substituted "that" for "which" in Subsection C(4), while deleting "is not deductible" at the end of that subsection.

Effect on government's contract costs does not invalidate tax. — That the gross receipts tax may increase cost on a contract to the government does not validate the tax on the grounds that a state may not directly tax the federal government where its legal incidence falls elsewhere. United States v. New Mexico, 581 F.2d 803 (10th Cir. 1978), aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).  
Suppliers of personal property for federal agents entitled to deduction. — If contractors are procurement agents for the federal government, their suppliers of tangible personal property would be entitled to a tax deduction. United States v. New Mexico, 624 F.2d 111 (10th Cir. 1980), aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).  
Tax proper unless purchasing contractors agents of United States. — Since contracts do not authorize the contractors to act as agents of the United States in purchasing supplies and materials, an application of the gross receipts tax to the contractual transactions for materials and supplies is not unconstitutional. United States v. New Mexico, 581 F.2d 803 (10th Cir. 1978), aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).  
Construction project includes wide variety of activities. — This section was intended to make sales of construction materials to governmental entities taxable when 
the materials were to be incorporated into construction projects. Contrary to taxpayer's argument that Regulation GR 51:16 (now 3.2.1.11 NMAC) establishes a definite test for determining whether an endeavor is a "construction project," this regulation merely states nonexclusive guidelines for determining whether materials constitute a component part of a construction project. Thus, construction projects include the wide variety of activities listed in 7-9-3C NMSA 1978. Arco Materials, Inc. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1994-NMCA-062, 118 N.M. 12, 878 P.2d 330, rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Blaze Constr. Co. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1994-NMSC-110, 118 N.M. 647, 884 P.2d 803, cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1016, 115 S. Ct. 1359, 131 L. Ed. 2d 216 (1995).  
Direct passage of title to government insufficient to establish agency. — That title to tangible personal property passes directly from the vendor to the federal government is insufficient in itself to establish an agency relationship. United States v. New Mexico, 455 F. Supp. 993 (D.N.M. 1978), aff'd in part, rev'd in part on other grounds, 624 F.2d 111 (10th Cir. 1980), aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).  
Contract and circumstances establish agency relationship. — In determining whether contractors are procurement agents of the federal government, the surrounding facts and contract provisions must be analyzed, and specific words naming the contractors as agents are not required so long as it is clear from the contracts and the factual circumstances that the relationship is one of agency. United States v. New Mexico, 455 F. Supp. 993 (D.N.M. 1978), aff'd in part, rev'd in part on other grounds, 624 F.2d 111 (10th Cir. 1980), aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).  
Determining whether contractor was a federal agent. — Facts that contracts were management contracts, in existence for nearly 30 years and conducted in government-owned facilities with government-owned funds for the purpose of carrying out significant energy research and development administration statutory responsibilities, were important in determining whether contractor was an agent of the federal government. United States v. New Mexico, 455 F. Supp. 993 (D.N.M. 1978), aff'd in part, rev'd in part on other grounds, 624 F.2d 111 (10th Cir. 1980), aff'd, 455 U.S. 720, 102 S. Ct. 1373, 71 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1982).  
Tax may not be imposed on non-Indian for purchase price of materials for tribal housing project. — The state, through its bureau of revenue (now taxation and revenue department) and the commissioner of revenue (now secretary of the taxation and revenue department), may not impose upon a non-Indian construction company its gross receipts tax for the purchase price of materials used in connection with a tribal housing project on the Mescalero Apache reservation. Mescalero Apache Tribe v. O'Cheskey, 439 F. Supp. 1063 (D.N.M. 1977), aff'd, 625 F.2d 967 (10th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 959, 101 S. Ct. 1417, 67 L.

Telephone service. — Decision that a telephone company was not entitled to a deduction under this section for receipts collected for intrastate toll charges and local phone calls from certain government organizations and organizations which had been granted federal income tax exemptions would be held, since there was a reasonable basis for differentiating between electricity (declared to be tangible personalty at 7-9-3J NMSA 1978) and telephone communications where the evidence showed that more was involved in the telephone business than the selling of electricity. Leaco Rural Tel. Coop., Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1974-NMCA-076, 86 N.M. 629, 526 P.2d 426.  
7-9-54.1. Deduction; gross receipts from sale of aerospace services to certain organizations. 
A. Receipts from performing or selling an aerospace service for resale may be deducted from gross receipts if the sale is made to a buyer who delivers a nontaxable transaction certificate or provides alternative evidence pursuant to Section 7-9-43 NMSA 1978.  The buyer shall separately state the value of the aerospace service purchased in the buyer's charge for the aerospace service on its subsequent sale to an organization or, if the buyer is an organization, on the organization's subsequent sale to the United States, and the subsequent sale shall be in the ordinary course of business of selling aerospace services to an organization or to the United States. 
B. As used in this section: 
(1) "aerospace services" means research and development services sold to or for resale to an organization for resale by the organization to the United States air force; and 
(2) "organization" means an organization described in Subsection A of Section 7-9-29 NMSA 1978 other than a prime contractor operating facilities in New Mexico designated as a national laboratory by act of congress.

The 1993 amendment, effective July 1, 1993, inserted "governmental gross receipts tax" in the section heading; inserted the subsection designations A and C; and added Subsection B.  
Constitutionality. — The New Mexico gross receipts tax did not violate the commerce clause of the United States constitution, as applied to a California corporation which owned and operated a food and restaurant supply business with a warehouse located in Texas, and which sold food and other restaurant supplies to restaurants for use in New Mexico by obtaining orders for deliveries by telephoning the restaurants and taking down the orders over the phone, then delivering the goods in its own trucks from its warehouse in Texas to the restaurants in New Mexico. Proficient Food Co. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1988-NMCA-042, 107 N.M. 392, 758 P.2d 806, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 308, 756 P.2d 1203.  
All interstate commerce is not per se immune from taxation. Spillers v. Commissioner of Revenue, 1970-NMCA-097, 82 N.M. 41, 475 P.2d 41, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 81, 475 P.2d 778.  
Scope of deduction. — This section permits deduction from gross receipts to the extent that the imposition of gross receipts tax would be unlawful under the United States constitution. If imposition of the tax upon the particular gross receipts is constitutionally lawful then such receipts are not deductible hereunder. Spillers v. Commissioner of Revenue, 1970-NMCA-097, 82 N.M. 41, 475 P.2d 41, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 81, 475 P.2d 778.  
Federal law does not preempt tax assessed on receipts from transportation of railroad crew members within the state. — Where plaintiff contracted with union pacific railroad and burlington northern Santa Fe railroad to transport railroad employees to and from railroad trains both within New Mexico and from New Mexico to another state, and where the New Mexico taxation and revenue department (department), after an audit, assessed plaintiff for gross receipts on the revenues from plaintiff’s service between locations within New Mexico, and where plaintiff filed a complaint for tax refund claiming that federal law preempts the department from imposing gross receipts tax on the transportation of passengers traveling in interstate commerce by motor carrier, the district court did not err in granting the department’s motion for summary judgment, because Congress, in passing 49 U.S.C. §14505, intended to address passengers of a motor carrier who were traveling as passengers in interstate commerce, and plaintiff’s transportation of railroad crew members is not part of ticketed travel between states and thus the railroad crew members were not passengers traveling in interstate commerce traveling by motor carrier. Renzenberger, Inc. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep’t, 2018-NMCA-010, cert. denied.  
Immunity from undue burdens. — To attain immunity a showing must be made of multiple taxation or the lack of a local taxable incident. Such showing is essential to classify the tax as one unduly burdensome to interstate commerce. Spillers v. Commissioner of Revenue, 1970-NMCA-097, 82 N.M. 41, 475 P.2d 41, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 81, 475 P.2d 778.  
Multiple taxation. — If compensation received under advertising contracts is not protected by the commerce clause, then multiple taxation of the receipts would not bring them within such protection. N.M. Newspapers, Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1971-NMCA-022, 82 N.M. 436, 483 P.2d 317.  
Classification pursuant to constitutional mandate not violative of equal protection. — Granting a deduction, whether in accordance with statute or administrative regulations, of gross receipts which are not taxable by the state under the commerce clause, and denying such deduction with respect to receipts which are subject to state taxation, although the receipts in each instance are produced by comparable activities, is a reasonable and proper basis for classification. N.M. Newspapers, Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1971-NMCA-022, 82 N.M. 436, 483 P.2d 317.  
Equal protection. — Imposition of tax upon receipts derived by newspaper from advertising, while receipts of radio and television broadcasters are not taxed, does not constitute arbitrary and discriminatory treatment or classification in violation of the equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions. N.M. Newspapers, Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1971-NMCA-022, 82 N.M. 436, 483 P.2d 317.  
Educational materials. — Tax levied on gross receipts from out-of-state sales of tangible personal property in the nature of reproducible educational materials is an impermissible burden on commerce. Evco v. Jones, 409 U.S. 91, 93 S. Ct. 349, 34 L. Ed. 2d 325 (1972).  
Interstate telegraph messages. — Employee who transmitted telegraph messages both interstate and intrastate is allowed to deduct receipts derived from interstate messages from gross receipts under this section. Ealey v. Bureau of Revenue, 1976-NMSC-010, 89 N.M. 160, 548 P.2d 440.  
Access charges and telephone carriers. — Since the access charge is for the service of transmitting the telephone signal between the inter-local access and transport areas carrier's switching center and the local phone customer, such taxation of access charge receipts is barred by this section. GTE Sw., Inc. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1992-NMCA-024, 113 N.M. 610, 830 P.2d 162, cert. denied, 113 N.M. 605, 830 P.2d 157.  
Ancillary services and telephone carriers. — Gross receipts tax imposed on receipts for ancillary services performed for interstate carriers is proper even though these services are related to the provision of interstate telephone service; the receipts are not receipts from transmitting messages or conversations by telephone. GTE Sw., Inc. v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1992-NMCA-024, 113 N.M. 610, 830 P.2d 162, cert. denied, 113 N.M. 605, 830 P.2d 157.  
Newspaper advertising. — Assessment of gross receipts tax against receipts of taxpayer derived from out-of-state advertising published in its newspaper was not violative of the commerce clause. N.M. Newspapers, Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1971-NMCA-022, 82 N.M. 436, 483 P.2d 317.  
Commissions for booking transportation services. — Imposition of gross receipts tax upon commissions paid to a resident agent of an interstate carrier of household goods for initiating or booking interstate transportation of such goods does not violate the federal constitution, and consequently such receipts are not properly deductible. Spillers v. Commissioner of Revenue, 1970-NMCA-097, 82 N.M. 41, 475 P.2d 41, cert. denied, 82 N.M. 81, 475 P.2d 778.  
Burden on taxpayer. — Even if multiple taxation could be treated as invoking the protection of the commerce clause, the taxpayer, nevertheless, would have the burden of establishing his right to immunity from taxation. N.M. Newspapers, Inc. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1971-NMCA-022,82 N.M. 436, 483 P.2d 317.

McKinley Ambulance Serv. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1979-NMCA-026, 92 N.M. 599, 592 P.2d 515.  
Intrastate transportation receipts not deductible. — Transportation into one state from another is the indispensable test of interstate commerce. That there is both intrastate and interstate transportation under a single contract does not authorize a deduction under Subsection A for receipts attributable to the intrastate transportation. McKinley Ambulance Serv. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1979-NMCA-026, 92 N.M. 599, 592 P.2d 515.

The 2007 amendment, effective July 1, 2007, in Subsection A, changed "organizations" to "501(c)(3) organizations" and deleted the former qualification that organizations had to have been granted exemption from the federal income tax by the United States commissioner of internal revenue as organizations described in Section 501(c)(3) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended or renumbered; in Subsection B, added the exception that receipts from selling to a 501(c)(3) organization that is organized for the purpose of providing homeownership opportunities to low-income families may be deducted from gross receipts if the buyer delivers a nontaxable transaction certificate and the buyer uses the property in the conduct of functions described in Section 501(c)(3); and added Subsection C.

Telephone services not tangible personalty. — Decision that a telephone company was not entitled to a deduction under this section for receipts collected for intrastate toll charges and local phone calls from certain government organizations and organizations which had been granted federal income tax exemptions would be upheld, since there was a reasonable basis for differentiating between electricity (declared to be tangible personalty at Section 7-9-3J NMSA 1978) and telephone communications where the evidence showed that more was involved in the telephone business than the selling of electricity.

Aggregation of deliveries not authorized. — Since no single delivery or single day's delivery of chemicals or reagents to a well ever amounted to 18 tons or more, although the amount specified in a purchase order might aggregate that much, taxpayer was not entitled to a deduction under this section, since the wording of taxpayer's purchase orders and contract, supported inference that a purchase order was not a transfer for consideration and therefore not a sale. Runco Acidizing & Fracturing Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1974-NMCA-145, 87 N.M. 146, 530 P.2d 410.  
Statute is inapplicable to receipts from the sale and use of natural gas. — Where taxpayer, an electric power company, appealed from an administrative hearing officer's (AHO) decision and order denying its protest of New Mexico taxation and revenue department's denial of taxpayer's request for a tax refund based on its belief that its purchases of natural gas qualified for a deduction, the AHO did not err in denying taxpayer's protest because had the legislature intended to provide a deduction for receipts from the sale or use of natural gas, it could have specified the inclusion of natural gas within the statutory language establishing the deduction, as in the enactment of other legislation applicable to natural gas.

The 1991 amendment, effective July 1, 1991, inserted the subsection designation A at the beginning of the section and redesignated former Subsections A to C as Paragraphs (1) to (3) of Subsection A; rewrote the introductory paragraph of Subsection A which read "The value of tangible personal property other than furniture or appliances furnished as part of a leased or rented dwelling house or apartment by the landlord or lessor, other than coin-operated machines and other than mobile homes may be deducted in computing the compensating tax due if the person using the tangible personal property" and added Subsection B.  
Determining character of transaction. — The characterization of a transaction as a lease may be determined by looking to the intentions of the parties as evidenced by their actions with respect to the leased property. Music Serv. Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-114, 88 N.M. 432, 540 P.2d 1321.  
Lease and bailment distinguished. — Since taxpayer, which was in the business of providing coin-operated, amusement and vending equipment for use by business establishments for the pleasure or amusement of their patrons, utilized two types of agreements, one of which was a lease under which payment was made to taxpayer by a flat fee, whereas in the other type of agreement payment was made by a division of the proceeds from the machines under an oral agreement based on a document called "Agreement for Joint Operation of Amusement Devices," it was held that the taxpayer knew the difference between a lease agreement and a bailment for the mutual benefit of itself and a business establishment, supporting the inference that the relationship between taxpayer and establishment was not a lease. Music Serv. Co. v. Bureau of Revenue, 1975-NMCA-114, 88 N.M. 432, 540 P.2d 1321.  
Laundry transactions are leasings. — Since the taxpayer's coin-operated laundry business is used for a consideration by persons other than the owner, the transactions are "leasings" as defined in Section 7-9-3J NMSA 1978, and the taxpayer is entitled to a deduction from compensating tax liability for the value of the washers and dryers. Strebeck Props., Inc. v. New Mexico Bureau of Revenue, 1979-NMCA-035, 93 N.M. 262, 599 P.2d 1059.  
Construction of temporary provision. — Temporary provision enacted by Laws 1977, ch. 144, § 66, providing for exemption from higher tax rate for certain contracts "entered into prior to the passage of this act," necessarily referred to contracts entered into prior to July 1, 1969, the date on which, pursuant to N.M. Const., art. IV, § 23, the bill became law, and an attempt by the commissioner (now the secretary of the taxation and revenue department) to set by regulation an earlier cutoff date (the date on which the bill was signed by the governor) was invalid. R.H. Fulton, Inc. v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1973-NMCA-133, 85 N.M. 583, 514 P.2d 1079.  
Exemption not waived. — Failure to register pursuant to the terms of a regulation promulgated under a temporary exemption provision which was invalid because it set a 
cutoff date contrary to that provided by the legislature was not a waiver by the taxpayer of his rights under the statute. R.H. Fulton, Inc. v. N.M. Bureau of Revenue, 1973-NMCA-133, 85 N.M. 583, 514 P.2d 1079.  
Constitutionality of former temporary exemption. — Former 72-16-5D, 1953 Comp., which exempted lump-sum or unit-price contracts entered into prior to the effective date of the act, which by their terms would not permit a price increase in the event of imposition of additional tax, from the operation of the gross receipts tax, did not amount to an arbitrary or unreasonable distinction violative of principles of equal protection and uniform taxation. Gruschus v. Bureau of Revenue, 1965-NMSC-013, 74 N.M. 775, 399 P.2d 105 (decided under prior law).

B. The purpose of the high-wage jobs tax credit is to provide an incentive for urban and rural businesses to create and fill new high-wage jobs in New Mexico. 
C. The high-wage jobs tax credit may be claimed and allowed in an amount equal to eight and one-half percent of the wages distributed to an eligible employee in a new high-wage job but shall not exceed twelve thousand seven hundred fifty dollars ($12,750) per job per qualifying period.  The high-wage jobs tax credit may be claimed by an eligible employer for each new high-wage job performed for the year in which the new high-wage job is created and for consecutive qualifying periods. 
D. To receive a high-wage jobs tax credit, a taxpayer shall file an application for approval of the credit with the department once per calendar year on forms and in the manner prescribed by the department.  The annual application shall contain the certification required by Subsection K of this section and shall contain all qualifying periods that closed during the calendar year for which the application is made.  Any qualifying period that did not close in the calendar year for which the application is made shall be denied by the department.  The application for a calendar year shall be filed no later than December 31 of the following calendar year.

A new high-wage job shall not be eligible for a credit pursuant to this section for a consecutive qualifying period unless the total number of threshold jobs at a location at which the job is performed or based on the last day of that qualifying period is greater than or equal to the number of threshold jobs at that same location on the last day of the initial qualifying period for the new high-wage job. 
F. If a consecutive qualifying period for a new high-wage job does not meet the wage, occupancy and residency requirements, then the qualifying period is ineligible.

"New job" defined. — The term "new high-wage economic-based job" is defined under the high-wage jobs tax credit as "a new job created in New Mexico by an eligible employer that is occupied for at least forty-eight weeks of a qualifying period by an eligible employee."  A "new job," for purposes of § 7-9G-1(M)(5) NMSA 1978, is brought into being by the creation of a new position that did not previously exist.  Par Five Servs., LLC v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep't and Mosaic Potash Carlsbad Inc. v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep't, 2021-NMCA-025. 
Methodologies for determining whether taxpayers have created a "new job" are within the taxation and revenue department's authority. — The taxation and revenue department (department) has the authority to devise means and methods to evaluate whether a taxpayer is entitled to a credit because such powers arise from the statutory language by fair and necessary implication, and therefore it is within the department's authority to employ two different methodologies known as the "replacement analysis" and the "career path promotion analysis" to determine whether taxpayers have created a "new job" for purposes of the high-wage jobs tax credit.  Par Five Servs., LLC v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep't and Mosaic Potash Carlsbad Inc. v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep't, 2021-NMCA-025. 
The department's use of the "replacement analysis" for determining whether taxpayers have created a new job is not unreasonable. — In consolidated appeals, where administrative hearing officers upheld the taxation and revenue department's (department) denial of  high-wage jobs tax credits for employees on the basis that the hiring of these employees did not create "new jobs," because the hired employees merely filled vacancies left by employees who had previously held the same job positions, the department's methodology, known as the "replacement analysis," to determine whether taxpayers have created a "new job" for purposes of the high-wage jobs tax credit or whether a taxpayer merely filled a vacant preexisting position is reasonable, because the replacement analysis is consistent with the legislative purpose of the high-wage jobs tax credit in that it guards against potential abuse while simultaneously serving as an aid to determine whether a job position is truly "new".  Par Five Servs., LLC v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep't and Mosaic Potash Carlsbad Inc. v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep't, 2021-NMCA-025. 
The department's use of the "career path promotion analysis" for determining whether taxpayers have created a "new job" is not unreasonable. — Where the taxation and revenue department (department) appealed an administrative hearing officer's reversal of the department's denial of the high-wage jobs tax credit under the "career path promotion" analysis, which the department utilizes when an existing employee is promoted to a different position, in order to determine whether a "new job" has been created, the hearing officer erred in overturning the department's denial, because the department's use of the "career path promotion analysis" is reasonable; the "career path promotion analysis" aims to ascertain whether a claimed "new job" is 
actually a new position and to prevent employers from abusing the statutory scheme to generate tax credit awards not contemplated by the legislature.  Par Five Servs., LLC v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep't and Mosaic Potash Carlsbad Inc. v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep't, 2021-NMCA-025.  
Disputing the denial of an application for a high-wage jobs tax credit. — Where taxpayer submitted an application for a high-wage jobs tax credit, which was denied by the Department of Taxation and Revenue (Department), and where taxpayer did not file a written protest to the department’s denial of its credit application, pursuant to 7-1-24 NMSA 1978, but rather filed an application for refund pursuant to 7-1-26 NMSA 1978, based on its original credit application, which was also denied by the department, and where taxpayer filed a written protest to the denial of its refund application, and where, following multiple hearings before the administrative hearing officer, the department filed a motion for summary judgment, and where the administrative hearing officer granted the department’s motion, concluding that the only available remedy for a denial of an application for a tax credit was to file a protest within ninety days of the denial pursuant to 7-1-24 NMSA 1978, and that taxpayer’s failure to file such a protest rendered the department’s denial indisputable, the administrative hearing officer erred in granting the department’s motion for summary judgment and denying taxpayer’s protest, because neither the applicable statutes nor the department’s own guidance suggest that a taxpayer’s sole remedy to dispute the denial of a high-wage jobs tax credit is through the protest procedures provided in 7-1-24 NMSA 1978.  The plain language of both 7-1-24 and 7-1-26 NMSA 1978 indicates that the two statutes exist as alternatives and a taxpayer may dispute a denial of a tax credit under either statute.  Elite Well v.

7-13-3.1. Gasoline inventory tax; imposition of tax; date payment of tax due. 
A. A gasoline inventory tax is imposed measured by the quantity of gallons of gasoline in the possession of a distributor or wholesaler on the day in which an increase in the excise tax imposed by Section 7-13-3 NMSA 1978 is effective. The taxable event is the existence of an inventory in the possession of a distributor or wholesaler on the day prior to the day in which an increase in the excise tax imposed by Section 7-13-3 NMSA 1978 is effective. The rate of the gasoline inventory tax to apply on each gallon of gasoline held in inventory by a distributor or wholesaler, as provided in Section 7-13-3.2 NMSA 1978, shall be the difference between the gasoline excise tax rate imposed on the day prior to the day in which the gasoline excise tax is increased subtracted from the gasoline excise tax rate imposed on the day that the gasoline excise tax rate increase is effective, expressed in cents per gallon.  
B. The gasoline inventory tax is to be paid to the department on or before the twenty-fifth day of the month following the month in which the taxable event occurs.

A. Except as provided in Subsection H of this section, every taxpayer shall file with the department a bond on a form approved by the attorney general with a surety company authorized by the state corporation commission [public regulation commission] to transact business in this state as a surety and upon which bond the taxpayer is the principal obligor and the state the obligee. The bond shall be conditioned upon the prompt filing of true reports and the payment by the taxpayer to the department of all taxes levied by the Gasoline Tax Act, together with all applicable penalties and interest thereon.  
B. In lieu of the bond, the taxpayer may elect to file with the department cash or bonds of the United States or New Mexico or of any political subdivision of the state.  
C. The total amount of the bond, cash or securities required of any taxpayer shall be fixed by the department and may be increased or reduced by the department at any time, subject to the limitations provided in this section.  
D. In fixing the total amount of the bond, cash or securities required of any taxpayer required to post bond, the department shall require an equivalent in total amount to at least two times the amount of the department's estimate of the taxpayer's monthly gasoline tax, determined in such manner as the secretary may deem proper; provided, however, the total amount of bond, cash or securities required of a taxpayer shall never be less than one thousand dollars ($1,000).  
E. In the event the department decides that the amount of the existing bond, cash or securities is insufficient to insure payment to this state of the amount of the gasoline tax and any penalties and interest for which the taxpayer is or may at any time become liable, then the taxpayer, upon written demand of the department mailed to the last known address of the taxpayer as shown on the records of the department, shall file an additional bond, cash or securities in the manner, form and amount determined by the

F.

On receipt of notice of such request, the department promptly shall notify the taxpayer who furnished the bond that the taxpayer, on or before the expiration of the ninety-day period, shall file with the department a new bond with a surety satisfactory to the department in the amount and form required in this section.  
G. The taxpayer required to file bond with or provide cash or securities to the department in accordance with this section and who is required by another state law to file another bond with or provide cash or securities to the department may elect to file a combined bond or provide cash or securities applicable to the provisions of both this section and the other law, with the approval of the secretary. The amount of the combined bond, cash or securities shall be determined by the department, and the form of the combined bond shall be approved by the attorney general.  
H. Every taxpayer who, for the twenty-four month period immediately preceding July 1, 1994, has not been a delinquent taxpayer pursuant to the Gasoline Tax Act is exempt from the requirement pursuant to this section to file a bond. A taxpayer required to file a bond pursuant to the provisions of this section who, for a twenty-four consecutive month period ending after July 1, 1994, has not been a delinquent taxpayer pursuant to the Gasoline Tax Act may request to be exempt from the requirement to file a bond beginning with the first day of the first month following the end of the twenty-four month period. If a taxpayer exempted pursuant to this subsection subsequently becomes a delinquent taxpayer under the Gasoline Tax Act, the department may terminate the exemption and require the filing of a bond in accordance with this section.

(6) on wine manufactured or produced by a small winegrower and sold in this state, provided that proof is furnished to the department that the wine was manufactured or produced by a small winegrower: 
(a) ten cents ($.10) per liter on the first eighty thousand liters sold; 
(b) twenty cents ($.20) per liter on each liter sold over eighty thousand liters but not over nine hundred fifty thousand liters; and

C. A transfer of wine from a winegrower to a wholesaler for distribution of the wine transfers the liability for payment of the liquor excise tax to the wholesaler upon the sale of the wine by the wholesaler.

This section does not implicate or violate the dormant Commerce Clause. — The dormant Commerce Clause, U.S. Const., Art. I, Sec. 8, limits state regulation of interstate commerce and is primarily concerned with preventing economic protectionism by states, and although NMSA 1978, § 7-17-5(A)(5) provides a lower excise tax rate on beer manufactured or produced by a microbrewer and sold in this state, it does not limit this lower tax rate to beer manufactured or produced in this state; this section does not differentiate between in-state and out-of-state craft distillers or give in-state craft distillers a competitive advantage over out-of-state craft distillers. Section 7-17-5(A)(5)’s purpose and effect are not discriminatory or protectionist and therefore do not implicate or violate the dormant Commerce Clause.  2024 Op. Att’y Gen. No. 24-02. 
Proposed legislation does not discriminate against interstate commerce. — Proposed legislation that seeks to raise the basic alcohol tax rates imposed by NMSA 1978, § 7-17-5, does not implicate or violate the dormant Commerce Clause, U.S. Const., Art. I, § 8; a statute may be invalidated only where the burden imposed on interstate commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits, and the proposed legislation in this case does not distinguish between in-state and out-of-state economic interests on its face and does not discriminate against interstate commerce in its effects.  The proposed legislation seeks to unify tax rates for all spiritous liquors, whether the wholesaler selling the alcoholic beverage sells products produced in-state or out-of-state, and does not place a burden on interstate commerce.  2024 Op. Att’y Gen. No. 24-02.

B. The governing body of a municipality enacting an ordinance imposing the tax authorized in Subsection A of this section shall submit the question of imposing such tax and the question of the issuance of supplemental municipal gross receipts bonds in an amount not to exceed nine million dollars ($9,000,000), for which the revenue from the supplemental municipal gross receipts tax is dedicated, to the qualified electors of the municipality at a regular or special election.  
C. The questions referred to in Subsection B of this section shall be submitted to a vote of the qualified electors of the municipality as two separate ballot questions which shall be substantially in the following form:  
(1) "Shall the municipality be authorized to issue supplemental municipal gross receipts bonds in an amount of not exceeding __________________ dollars for

For ____________ Against ____________"; and  
(2) "Shall the municipality impose an excise tax for the privilege of engaging in business in the municipality which shall be known as the "supplemental municipal gross receipts tax" and which shall be imposed at a rate of ____________ percent of the gross receipts of the person engaging in business, the proceeds of which are dedicated to the payment of supplemental municipal gross receipts bonds?

The governing body of the municipality shall determine at its discretion the terms, covenants and conditions of the supplemental municipal gross receipts bonds, including but not limited to, date of issuance, denomination, maturity, coupon rates, call features, premium, registration, refundability and other matters covering the general and technical aspects of their issuance. These bonds may be either serial or term and may be sold by the governing body of the municipality at the time and in the manner as the governing body may elect, at either public or private sale.

7-19-17.1. Refunding bonds; authorization. 
A. Any municipality may issue refunding bonds for the purpose of refinancing, paying and discharging all or any part of outstanding supplemental municipal gross receipts tax bonds of any one or more or all outstanding issues:  
(1) for the acceleration, deceleration or other modification of the payment of such obligations, including without limitation any capitalization of any interest thereon in arrears or about to become due for any period not exceeding one year from the date of the refunding bonds;  
(2) for the purpose of reducing interest costs or affecting other economies;  
(3) for the purpose of modifying or eliminating restrictive contractual limitations pertaining to the issuance of additional bonds, otherwise concerning the outstanding bonds or to any facilities relating thereto; or  
(4) for any combination of such purposes.  
B. The municipality may pledge irrevocably for the payment of interest and principal on refunding bonds the appropriate pledged revenues, which may be pledged to an original issue of bonds as provided in the Supplemental Municipal Gross Receipts Tax Act. Nothing in this section shall permit the pledge of the gross receipts tax revenue to the payment of bonds that refund bonds issued under any other provision of law.  
C. Refunding bonds may be issued separately or issued in combination in one series or more.  
D. Refunding bonds issued pursuant to the Supplemental Municipal Gross Receipts Tax Act shall be authorized by ordinance. Any bonds that are refunded under the provisions of this section shall be paid at maturity or on any permitted prior redemption date in the amounts, at the time and places and, if called prior to maturity, in accordance with any applicable notice provisions, all as provided in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the refunded bonds, or otherwise appertaining thereto, except for any such bond that is voluntarily surrendered for exchange or payment by the holder or owner.  
E. Provision shall be made for paying the bonds refunded at the time or places provided in Subsection D of this section. The principal amount of the refunding bonds shall not exceed, but may be less than or be the same as the principal amount of the 
bonds being refunded so long as provision is duly and sufficiently made for the payment of the refunded bonds.  
F. The proceeds of refunding bonds, including any accrued interest and premium appertaining to the sale of refunding bonds, shall either be immediately applied to the retirement of the bonds being refunded or be placed in escrow in a commercial bank or trust company that possesses and is exercising trust powers and that is a member of the federal deposit insurance corporation, to be applied to the payment of the principal of, interest on and any prior redemption premium due in connection with the bonds being refunded; provided that such refunding bond proceeds, including any accrued interest and any premium appertaining to a sale of refunding bonds, may be applied to the establishment and maintenance of a reserve fund and to the payment of expenses incidental to the refunding and the issuance of the refunding bonds, the interest on the refunding bonds and the principal of the refunding bonds or both interest and principal as the municipality may determine. Nothing in this section requires the establishment of an escrow if the refunded bonds become due and payable within one year from the date of the refunding bonds and if the amounts necessary to retire the refunded bonds within that time are deposited with the paying agent for the refunded bonds. Any such escrow shall not necessarily be limited to proceeds of refunding bonds but may include other money available for its escrow purpose. Any proceeds in escrow pending such use may be invested or reinvested in bills, certificates of indebtedness, notes or bonds that are direct obligations of or the principal and interest of which obligations are unconditionally guaranteed by the United States or in certificates of deposit of banks that are members of the federal deposit insurance corporation, the par value of which certificates of deposit is collateralized by a pledge of obligations of or the payment of which is unconditionally guaranteed by the United States, the par value of which obligations is [at] least seventy-five percent of the par value of the certificates of deposit. Such proceeds and investments in escrow together with any interest or other income to be derived from any such investment shall be in an amount at all times sufficient as to principal, interest, any prior redemption premium due and any charges of the escrow agent payable therefrom to pay the bonds being refunded as they become due at their respective maturities or due at any designated prior redemption date in connection with which the municipality shall exercise a prior redemption option. Any purchaser of any refunding bond issued pursuant to the provisions of the Supplemental Municipal Gross Receipts Tax Act is in no manner responsible for the application of the proceeds thereof by the municipality or any of its officers, agents or employees.  
G. Refunding bonds may be sold at a public or negotiated sale and may bear such additional terms and provisions as may be determined by the municipality subject to limitations in the Supplemental Municipal Gross Receipts Tax Act. The terms, provisions and authorization of the refunding bonds are not subject to the provisions of any other statute, provided that the Public Securities Limitation of Action Act [6-14-4 to 6-14-7 NMSA 1978] shall be fully applicable to the issuance of refunding bonds.  
H. The municipality shall receive from the department of finance and administration written approval of any refunding bonds issued pursuant to the provisions of this section.

(2) if the ordinance does not contain a mandatory election provision as provided in Paragraph (1) of this subsection, upon the filing of a petition requesting such an election if the petition is filed:

(b) in all other municipalities, with the municipal clerk within thirty days after the adoption of such ordinance and the petition has been signed by a number of registered voters in the municipality equal to at least five percent of the number of the voters in the municipality who were registered to vote in the most recent regular municipal election. 
E. The signatures on the petition filed in accordance with Subsection D of this section shall be verified by the municipal clerk.  If the petition is verified by the municipal clerk as containing the required number of signatures of registered voters, the governing body shall adopt an election resolution calling for the holding of a special election on the question of approving or disapproving the ordinance unless the ordinance is repealed before the adoption of the election resolution.  An election held pursuant to Subparagraph (a) or (b) of Paragraph (2) of Subsection D of this section shall be called, conducted and canvassed as provided in the Local Election Act, and the election shall be held within seventy-five days after the date the petition is verified by the municipal clerk or it may be held in conjunction with a regular local election if such election occurs within seventy-five days after the date of verification by the municipal clerk. 
F. If at an election called pursuant to Subsection D of this section a majority of the registered voters voting on the question approves the ordinance imposing the tax, the ordinance shall become effective in accordance with the provisions of the Municipal Local Option Gross Receipts and Compensating Taxes Act.  If at such an election a majority of the registered voters voting on the question disapproves the ordinance, the ordinance imposing the tax shall be deemed repealed and the question of imposing any increment of the municipal gross receipts tax authorized in this section shall not be considered again by the governing body for a period of one year from the date of the election. 
G. Any law that imposes or authorizes the imposition of a municipal gross receipts tax or that affects the municipal gross receipts tax, or any law supplemental thereto or otherwise appertaining thereto, shall not be repealed or amended or otherwise directly or indirectly modified in such a manner as to impair adversely any outstanding revenue bonds that may be secured by a pledge of such municipal gross receipts tax unless such outstanding revenue bonds have been discharged in full or provision has been fully made therefor.

The tax may be imposed in one or more increments of one-sixteenth percent not to exceed an aggregate rate of one-fourth percent. The tax shall be imposed for a period of not more than ten years from the effective date of the ordinance imposing the tax.

A board member shall not serve for more than two consecutive terms.  
F. The municipal cultural advisory board shall have the responsibility of overseeing the distribution of the quality of life gross receipts tax revenue for the goals listed in Subsection D of this section. The board shall:  
(1) biennially submit recommendations to the governing body for expenditures of revenue from the quality of life gross receipts tax that are allocated pursuant to this section through contracts for services with appropriate organizations and institutions;

(3) develop guidelines and procedures for applying for funding through a request for proposals process and the criteria by which contracts will be awarded. The evaluation process shall include a public review component.  
G. The municipal cultural advisory board shall establish reporting requirements for recipients of the quality of life gross receipts tax revenue. The board shall provide to the governing body an annual evaluation of the use of revenue from the quality of life gross receipts tax to ensure that it is meeting the goals listed in Subsection D of this section.  
H. Every four years, the municipal cultural advisory board shall review and revise as necessary:  
(1) the guidelines and procedures for applying for funding; and  
(2) the criteria by which applications for funding will be evaluated.

As used in the Resources Excise Tax Act:  
A. "department" means the taxation and revenue department, the secretary of taxation and revenue or any employee of the department exercising authority lawfully delegated to that employee by the secretary;  
B. "natural resource" means timber and any product thereof and any metalliferous or nonmetalliferous mineral product, combination or compound thereof, severed in New Mexico but does not include oil, natural gas, liquid hydrocarbon individually or any combination thereof, carbon dioxide, helium or nonhydrocarbon gas;  
C. "person" means any individual, estate, trust, receiver, cooperative association, club, corporation, company, firm, partnership, joint venture, syndicate or other entity;  
D. "processing" means smelting, leaching, refining, reducing, compounding or otherwise preparing for sale or commercial use any natural resource so that its character or condition is materially changed in mills or plants located in New Mexico;  
E. "processor" means any person engaging in the business of processing natural resources that the person owns, or any person who is the owner of natural resources and who has another person perform the processing of such natural resources;  
F. "service charge" means the total amount of money or the reasonable value of other consideration received for severing or processing any natural resource by any person who is not the owner of the natural resource. However, if the money received does not represent the value of the severing or processing performed, "service charge" means the reasonable value of the severing or processing performed;  
G. "severer" means any person engaging in the business of severing natural resources that the person owns, or any person who is the owner of natural resources and who has another person perform the severing of such natural resources;

I. "taxable value" means the value after severing or processing, without deduction of any kind other than specified in this subsection, of any natural resource severed or processed in New Mexico. It is presumed, in the absence of preponderant evidence of another value, that the taxable value means the total amount of money or the reasonable value of other consideration received for the severed or processed natural resource. However, if the amount of money received does not represent the value of the severed or processed natural resource or if the severed or processed natural resource is not sold, the taxable value shall be the reasonable value of the severed or processed natural resource. All natural resources severed or processed in New Mexico shall be included in determining taxable value, regardless of the place of sale or the fact that delivery may be made to points outside of New Mexico. If any person shall ship, transmit or transport natural resources out of New Mexico without making sale of them or shall ship, transmit or transport natural resources out of New Mexico in an unfinished condition, the value of the natural resources in the condition in which they existed when shipped, transmitted or transported out of New Mexico and before they enter interstate commerce, without deduction of any kind other than specified in this subsection, shall be the basis for determining the taxable value. Amounts received from selling natural resources, other than metalliferous mineral ores, whether processed or unprocessed, to the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof, the state of New Mexico or any political subdivision thereof, or to organizations that have demonstrated to the department that they have been granted exemption from the federal income tax by the United States commissioner of internal revenue as organizations described in Section 
501 (c) (3) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended or renumbered, which employ the natural resource in the conduct of functions described in Section 501 (c) (3) and not in the conduct of an unrelated trade or business as defined in Section 513 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended or renumbered, may be deducted from taxable value. Any royalty or other similar interest, whether payable in cash or in kind, paid to the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof, or the state of New Mexico or any political subdivision thereof, or any Indian tribe, Indian pueblo or Indian that is a ward of the United States may be deducted from taxable value. In computing taxable value, any owner of natural resources may deduct any service charge on which the service tax imposed by Section 7-25-6 NMSA 1978 is payable.

7-26-4. Determination of taxable value of natural resources. 
A. Except as otherwise provided in Subsections C, E, F and G of this section, the "taxable event" is the severance of a natural resource whose taxable value is determined under the provisions of this section.  
B. For all natural resources except potash or potash products described under Subsection C of this section, molybdenum or molybdenum products described under Subsection D of this section, copper, lead or zinc described in Subsection E of this section, gold described in Subsection F of this section, silver described in Subsection G of this section, coal and uranium, the gross value of the natural resource is the sales value of the severed and saved product at the first marketable point without any deductions, except that:  
(1) for those products having a posted field or market price at the point of production, the gross value is its posted field or market price, except that the gross value of potash is forty percent of the posted field or market price, less those expenses of hoisting, crushing and loading necessary to place the severed product in marketable form and at a marketable place, but the allowable deductions for hoisting, loading and crushing shall not exceed fifty percent of the posted field or market price; and  
(2) for those products that must be processed or beneficiated before sale, the gross value is the sales value after deducting freight charges from the point of severance to the point of first sale and the cost of processing or beneficiation.  
C. The gross value for each type of potash and potash product requiring processing or beneficiation (other than sizing), regardless of the form in which the product is actually sold, shall be thirty-three and one-third percent of the proceeds realized from the sale of muriate of potash and sulphate of potash magnesia, as standard grades, and thirty-three and one-third percent of the value of such products consumed in the production of other potash products, less fifty percent of such reported value as a deduction for expenses of hoisting, loading, crushing, processing and beneficiation. For purposes of this subsection, the taxable event occurs when products are sold or 
consumed. Any potash or potash products, the value of which is computed under this subsection, shall not also have their value computed by the use of any of the provisions of Subsection B of this section.  
D. The gross value for each type of molybdenum and molybdenum product requiring processing or beneficiation, regardless of the form in which the product is actually sold, shall be the value of molybdenum contained in concentrates shipped or sold from a mine site, but in no event a value less than the value that bona fide sales which reflect current market conditions would yield for the same quantity of molybdenum products contained in concentrates at the mine site, less fifty percent of that value as a deduction for the expenses of hoisting, loading, crushing, processing and beneficiation.  
E. The gross value for copper, lead and zinc shall be sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the sales value established from published price data, as further described in this subsection, of the quantity of copper, lead or zinc recoverable from the concentrate or other product which is sold or is shipped, transmitted or transported out of New Mexico without sale, less fifty percent of the sales value as a deduction for the expenses of hoisting, loading, crushing, processing and beneficiation. For purposes of this subsection, the taxable event occurs when the severer sells copper, lead or zinc in New Mexico or when the severer ships, transmits or transports copper, lead or zinc out of New Mexico without first making sale of it. The secretary shall designate by regulation which published price index shall be used to establish the sales value for each resource. The sales value for each resource shall be the monthly average price published for each resource for the month in which the taxable event occurs. When the taxable event is sale, the recoverable quantity of copper, lead or zinc shall be reported as the provisional quantity determined by presale assay, and the reported quantity may be adjusted in a report filed after final assay, if necessary. When the taxable event is shipment, transmission or transportation out of New Mexico without sale, the recoverable quantity of copper, lead or zinc shall be reported as the provisional quantity determined after preshipment assay. Copper, lead or zinc shall not be considered saved for the purposes of the Severance Tax Act unless the copper, lead or zinc can economically be separated and saved from the dominant resource, which is the resource subject to sale by the severer. Any copper, lead or zinc the value of which is computed under this subsection shall not also have its value computed by the use of any of the provisions of Subsection B of this section.  
F. The gross value for gold shall be the sales value established from published price data, as further described in this subsection, of the quantity of gold recoverable from the concentrate or other product which is sold or is shipped, transmitted or transported out of New Mexico without sale, less fifty percent of the sales value as a deduction for the expenses of hoisting, loading, crushing, processing and beneficiation. For purposes of this subsection, the taxable event occurs when the severer sells gold in New Mexico or when the severer ships, transmits or transports gold out of New Mexico without first making sale of it. The secretary shall designate by regulation which published price index shall be used to establish the sales value for gold. The sales 
value for gold shall be the monthly average price published for gold for the month in which the taxable event occurs. When the taxable event is sale, the recoverable quantity of gold shall be reported as the provisional quantity determined by presale assay, and the reported quantity may be adjusted in a report filed after final assay, if necessary. When the taxable event is shipment, transmission or transportation out of New Mexico without sale, the recoverable quantity of gold shall be reported as the provisional quantity determined after preshipment assay. For purposes of the Severance Tax Act, gold shall not be considered saved unless the gold can economically be separated and saved from the dominant resource, which is the resource subject to sale by the severer. Any gold the value of which is computed under this subsection shall not also have its value computed by the use of any of the provisions of Subsection B of this section.  
G. The gross value for silver shall be eighty percent of the sales value established from published price data, as further described in this subsection, of the quantity of silver recoverable from the concentrate or other product which is sold or is shipped, transmitted or transported out of New Mexico without sale, less fifty percent of the sales value as a deduction for the expenses of hoisting, loading, crushing, processing and beneficiation. For purposes of this subsection, the taxable event occurs when the severer sells silver in New Mexico or when the severer ships, transmits or transports silver out of New Mexico without first making sale of it. The secretary shall designate by regulation which published price index shall be used to establish the sales value for silver. The sales value for silver shall be the monthly average price published for silver for the month in which the taxable event occurs. When the taxable event is sale, the recoverable quantity of silver shall be reported as the provisional quantity determined by presale assay, and the reported quantity may be adjusted in a report filed after final assay, if necessary. When the taxable event is shipment, transmission or transportation out of New Mexico without sale, the recoverable quantity of silver shall be reported as the provisional quantity determined after preshipment assay. For purposes of the Severance Tax Act, silver shall not be considered saved unless the silver can economically be separated and saved from the dominant resource, which is the resource subject to sale by the severer. Any silver the value of which is computed under this subsection shall not also have its value computed by the use of any of the provisions of Subsection B of this section.  
H. The taxable value of all severed natural resources except coal and uranium is the gross value of the severed resource determined under this section less rental or royalty payments belonging to the United States or the state.  
I. The taxable value to be reported for severed and saved uranium-bearing material is the sales price per pound of the content of U3O8 contained in the severed and saved or processed uranium, regardless of the form in which the product is actually disposed of, reduced by fifty percent for the purposes of Section 7-26-7 NMSA 1978. It is presumed, in the absence of preponderant evidence of another value, that the sales price means the total amount of money and the reasonable value of other consideration received, or either of them, for the severed and saved uranium ore or processed 
uranium "yellowcake" concentrate without deduction of any kind. However, if the severed and saved uranium ore or "yellowcake" concentrate is not sold as ore or concentrate, the sales price shall be the value of U3O8 in ore or "yellowcake" concentrate represented in the final product.

7-26-6. Severance tax on coal; surtax. 
A. The severance tax on coal is measured by the quantity of coal severed and saved. The taxable event is sale, transportation out of New Mexico or consumption of the coal, whichever first occurs. Upon each short ton (two thousand pounds) of coal severed and saved, there shall be imposed on the severer a severance tax. For the period commencing on July 1, 1982, the severance tax rate shall be:  
(1) surface coal, fifty-seven cents ($.57); and  
(2) underground coal, fifty-five cents ($.55).  
B. The severance tax on coal shall be increased by a surtax, hereby imposed. The surtax shall be imposed on the unit of quantity of such product or natural resource at the following rates:  
(1) surface coal, sixty cents ($.60); and  
(2) underground coal, fifty-eight cents ($.58).  
C. The surtax rate on coal shall be increased on July 1, 1994, and on July 1 of each succeeding year by an amount equal to the product of the dollar amount of the severance tax imposed on each ton of coal by a percentage equal to the percentage rise in the producer price index for coal from the calendar year 1992 to the calendar year just prior to the year in which the surtax rates are computed, but in no case shall the surtax rate be decreased. The rates so computed shall be computed by the department in April of 1994 and in April of each year thereafter and published on or before May 1, 1994 and on or before May 1 of each year thereafter.  
If the producer price index for coal is substantially revised or if the base year used as an index of one hundred is changed, the department shall make an adjustment in the percentage used to compute the surtax rates that would produce results equivalent, as nearly as possible, to those that would have been obtained if the producer price index for coal had not been so revised or if the base year had not been changed. If this index ceases to become available, then a comparable index based upon changes in the price of coal shall be adopted by the department by regulation.  
D. As used in this section:  
(1) "producer price index for coal" means the commodity code 05-1 as reported annually by the bureau of labor statistics at the United States department of labor in their annual producer price indexes data;  
(2) "surface coal" means coal that is severed using surface mining methods;  
(3) "surface mining" means the extraction of coal from the earth by removing the material overlying a coal seam and then removing the coal by common methods, including, but not limited to, contour mining, strip mining, mountain top removal mining, box cut mining, open pit mining and area mining; and  
(4) "underground coal" means all coal that is not surface coal.

7-26-6.2. Coal surtax exemption; qualification requirements. 
A. The following coal is exempt from the surtax imposed on coal under the provisions of Section 7-26-6 NMSA 1978:  
(1) coal sold and delivered pursuant to coal sales contracts that are entered into on or after July 1, 1990, under which deliveries start after July 1, 1990, if the sales contracts are not the result of:  
(a) a producer and purchaser mutually rescinding an existing contract and negotiating a revised contract under substantially similar terms and conditions;  
(b) a purchaser establishing an affiliated company to purchase coal on behalf of the purchaser; or  
(c) a purchaser independently abrogating a contract that was in effect on July 1, 1990 with a producer for the purpose of securing the benefits of the exemption granted by this section; and  
(2) coal sold and delivered pursuant to a contract in effect on July 1, 1990 that exceeds the average calendar year deliveries under the contract during production years 1987, 1988 and 1989 or the highest contract minimum during 1987, 1988 and 1989, whichever is greater.  
B. If a contract existing on July 1, 1990 is renegotiated between a producer and a purchaser after May 20, 1992 and if that renegotiated contract requires the purchaser to take annual coal deliveries in excess of the greater of the average calendar year deliveries under the contract during production years 1987, 1988 and 1989 or the highest contract minimum during 1987, 1988 and 1989, the surtax imposed by Subsection B of Section 7-26-6 NMSA 1978 shall not apply to such excess deliveries for the remaining term of the renegotiated contract.  
C. For coal exempt under the provisions of Paragraph (2) of Subsection A of this section, if the contract involved was for a lesser term during the production years specified, then actual deliveries shall be annualized to establish average calendar year deliveries, and in the event that coal sold and delivered in a calendar year after June 30, 2009 falls below the average calendar year deliveries during 1987, 1988 and 1989, the exemption shall no longer apply unless the deliveries are reduced due to causes beyond the reasonable control of either party to the contract.  
D. The taxpayer, prior to taking the exemption provided by this section, shall register any contract for the sale of coal that qualifies for the exemption from the surtax under the provisions of this section with the department on forms provided by the secretary. If upon examination of the contract or upon audit or inspection of transactions occurring under the contract the secretary or the secretary's delegate determines that a person who is a party to the contract has taken an action to circumvent the intent and purpose of this section, the exemption shall be disallowed.

7-27-5.14. Findings and purpose. 
The legislature finds that the health of the New Mexico economy is heavily dependent on the establishment and expansion of small businesses and that the lack of available private equity is an impediment to the start-up and growth of businesses in the state. The legislature further finds that the commercialization of technology conceived in the universities and the federal scientific and engineering laboratories and test facilities in the state is likely to occur elsewhere unless sources of local private equity are developed. The purpose of Section 7-27-5.15 NMSA 1978 is to provide a mechanism whereby the establishment of private equity funds, whose investment policies are supportive of the economic welfare of New Mexico, will be stimulated.

The 2005 amendment, effective July 1, 2005, imposed the severance tax on helium and non-hydrocarbon gases in Subsection A(10).  
The 1999 amendment, effective June 18, 1999, substituted "pursuant to" for "under" throughout the section; substituted "Paragraphs (4), (6) and (7)" for "Paragraph (4)" in Subsection A(1); inserted "(8) and (9)" in Subsection A(2); deleted "in excess of the production projection" preceding "certified" and substituted "two and forty-five hundredths percent" for "one and seven-eighths percent" in Subsections A(4) and A(5); and added Subsections A(6) through A(9), redesignating former Subsection A(6) as A(10).  
The 1995 amendment, effective June 16, 1995, in Subsection A, added the exception at the end of the first sentence, rewrote Paragraph (1), substituted "Paragraphs (3) and (5)" for "Paragraph (3)" in Paragraph (2), added Paragraphs (4) and (5), and redesignated former Paragraph (4) as Paragraph (6); added subsection B; and redesignated former Subsections B and C as Subsections C and D.  
The 1992 amendment, effective March 6, 1992, in Subsection A, inserted "except as provided in Paragraph (3) of this subsection" in Paragraph (2), added Paragraph (3), made a related stylistic change, and redesignated former Paragraph (3) as Paragraph (4); and added Subsection C.

Tribe's power to impose severance tax not limited by federal government. — The federal interest in interstate commerce, manifested in traditional commerce clause analyses, does not limit the Jicarilla Apache tribe's power to impose an oil and gas severance tax to be measured by production of these products within the reservation. Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, 617 F.2d 537 (10th Cir. 1980), aff'd, 455 U.S. 130, 102 S. Ct. 894, 71 L. Ed. 2d 21 (1982).  
Non-Indian producers operating on reservations. — Oil and gas taxes imposed by the state against a non-Indian producer whose operations are located on an Indian reservation do not constitute an impermissible burden on interstate commerce, were not preempted by federal laws promoting tribal self-sufficiency, and may be imposed on the same on-reservation production of oil and gas by non-Indian lessees as is subject to the tribe's own severance tax. Cotton Petroleum v. State, 1987-NMCA-121, 106 N.M. 517,

Tax liability of interest owners. — Although, pursuant to Subsection C, each interest owner is liable for its proportionate share of the calculated tax, the law does not mandate or even contemplate the determination of different taxable values for each of the various interest owners based on proceeds received downstream from the wellhead. The law is satisfied so long as (1) carbon dioxide production is accurately measured and valued as a whole at the wellhead, (2) the appropriate tax rate is applied to that production to calculate the total tax owed, and (3) the total tax is allocated to the various interest owners in proportion to their fractional interest in that production. Any readjustment in the allocation of the tax burden among working interest owners and royalty interest owners is left to private contract. Feerer v. Amoco Prod. Co., 242 F.3d 1259 (10th Cir. 2001).  
Taxable value of carbon dioxide. — The calculation of severance taxes under New Mexico law, Subsection A(6) (now Subsection A(10)), is based on a single valuation of a total quantity of carbon dioxide extracted at the wellhead during a given time period. Feerer v. Amoco Prod. Co., 242 F.3d 1259 (10th Cir. 2001).

7-29-4.2. Value may be determined by department; standard. 
The department may determine the value of products severed from a production unit when:  
A. the operator and purchaser are affiliated persons;  
B. the sale and purchase of products is not an arm's length transaction; or when  
C. products are severed and removed from a production unit and a value as defined in the Oil and Gas Severance Tax Act is not established for such products.  
The value determined by the department shall be commensurate with the actual price received for products of like quality, character and use which are severed in the same field or area. If there are no sales of products of like quality, character and use severed in the same field or area, then the department shall establish a reasonable value.

Federal class action settlement agreement. — Where taxpayer was party to a settlement agreement that was approved by a federal district court in a class action involving the underpayment of royalties on the production of carbon dioxide gas; the settlement agreement settled the allegation that taxpayer had suppressed the price of carbon dioxide gas; and part of the proceeds of the settlement agreement were compensation to royalty interest owners for the failure to obtain a reasonable sales price 
for the carbon dioxide gas, the settlement agreement constituted an order that increased the value of the carbon dioxide gas previously reported by taxpayer and a taxable event under Section 7-29-4.3 NMSA 1978.

The method prescribed by this section shall be the exclusive method for determining the assessed value of products. The tax imposed by Section 7-32-4 NMSA 1978 of the Oil and Gas Ad Valorem Production Tax Act, together with the tax imposed by Section 7-34-4 NMSA 1978 of the Oil and Gas Production Equipment Ad Valorem Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 34 NMSA 1978], shall be the full and exclusive measure of ad valorem tax liability on the interests of all persons, including the operator and interest owners, in the production unit. Any other ad valorem tax on the production unit or on products severed therefrom is void.

Removal of carbon dioxide was not a field or lease operation. — Where taxpayer, which was a producer of coal seam gas, had carbon dioxide removed from the gas at a processing plant to make the gas marketable or acceptable to interstate pipelines, the taxpayer was subject to the natural gas processors tax, because the removal of carbon dioxide constituted a processing operation that was not exempt as a field or lease operation.

7-33-4. Privilege tax levied; collected by department; rate. 
A. There is levied and shall be collected by the department a privilege tax on processors for the privilege of operating a natural gas processing plant in New Mexico. This tax may be referred to as the "natural gas processors tax".  
B. The tax shall be imposed on the amount of mmbtus of natural gas delivered to the processor at the inlet of the natural gas processing plant after subtracting the mmbtu deductions authorized in Subsection E of this section. The tax shall be imposed at the rate per mmbtu determined in Subsection C or D of this section, as applicable.  
C. The tax rate for the six-month period beginning on January 1, 1999 shall be determined by multiplying the rate of sixty-five hundredths of one cent ($.0065) per mmbtu by a fraction, the numerator of which is the annual average taxable value per mcf of natural gas produced in New Mexico during the 1997 calendar year and the denominator of which is one dollar thirty-three cents ($1.33) per mcf. The resulting tax rate shall be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of one cent per mmbtu.  
D. The tax rate for each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 1999 shall be determined by multiplying the rate of sixty-five hundredths of one cent ($.0065) per mmbtu by a fraction, the numerator of which is the annual average taxable value per mcf of natural gas produced in New Mexico during the preceding calendar year and the denominator of which is one dollar thirty-three cents ($1.33) per mcf. The resulting tax rate shall be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of one cent per mmbtu.  
E. A processor may deduct from the amount of mmbtus of natural gas subject to the tax the mmbtus of natural gas that are:  
(1) used for natural gas processing by the processor;  
(2) returned to the lease from which it is produced;  
(3) legally flared by the processor; or  
(4) lost as a result of natural gas processing plant malfunctions or other incidences of force majeur.  
F. On or before June 15, 1999 and June 15 of each succeeding year, the department shall inform each processor in writing of the tax rate applicable for the succeeding fiscal year.  
G. Any Indian nation, tribe or pueblo or Indian is liable for the tax to the extent authorized or permitted by law.

ANNOTATIONS 
The 1998 amendment, effective January 1, 1999, deleted "oil and gas accounting division of the taxation and revenue" from the section heading and rewrote the section to the extent that a detailed comparison is impracticable.  
"Interest owners" liable under former section. — Under the version of this section in effect prior to its 1998 amendment, the "interest owner" of the natural gas was liable for the privilege tax on processing natural gas. Blackwood & Nichols Co. v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1998-NMCA-113, 125 N.M. 576, 964 P.2d 137, cert. denied, 126 N.M. 107, 967 P.2d 447 (decided under prior law).  
Marketable condition rule does not apply in New Mexico. — Where Appellants, several living trusts that held royalty interests on oil and gas leases (Trusts), brought a putative class action against Defendant, the owner and operator of natural gas wells on the leases, claiming that Defendant was systematically underpaying royalties by improperly deducting from their royalties their proportionate share of the costs incurred to place the gas produced from the wells in a marketable condition (post-production costs), the district court did not err in dismissing the Trusts’ claims, because under New Mexico law, Defendant had a duty to diligently market the gas for the benefit of the Trusts but that duty did not prohibit it from deducting from royalty payments the Trusts’ proportionate share of post-production costs, those costs necessary to make the gas marketable.  The marketable condition rule, which requires the lessor to market gas, but 
to do so solely at its expense, does not apply in New Mexico.  Anderson Living Trust v. Energen Resources Corp., 886 F.3d 826 (10th Cir. 2018). 
Third-party gas processors may pass tax onto owner and operator of natural gas well who may in turn pass tax onto interest owners. — Where Appellants, several living trusts that held royalty interests on oil and gas leases (Trusts), brought a putative class action against Defendant, the owner and operator of natural gas wells on the leases, claiming that Defendant was systematically underpaying royalties by improperly deducting from their royalties a privilege tax the State of New Mexico imposes on natural gas processors (the natural gas processors tax), the district court did not err in granting Defendant’s motion for summary judgment, because Subsection A of this section places the responsibility for paying the tax on natural gas processors, but there is nothing in this section that prohibits the processors from passing the tax onto Defendant, the owner and operator of the gas wells, or from Defendant passing the tax onto the interest owners.

ANNOTATIONS 
The 2018 amendment, effective May 16, 2018, defined "abandoned real property" as used in the Property Tax Code; added a new Subsection A and redesignated former Subsections A through P as Subsections B through Q, respectively; in Subsection D, after "useful to", changed "man" to "humans"; and in Subsection L, after "Subsection B of Section", deleted "7-38-90" and added "9-11-6.2".  
The second 1994 amendment, effective January 1, 2001, in Subsection C, inserted "buffalo" and "ratites", and deleted "excluding ratites" at the end.  
The first 1994 amendment, effective February 15, 1994, in Subsection C, inserted "buffalo", deleted "ratites" following "swine" and added "excluding ratites" at the end.  
The 1993 amendment, effective June 18, 1993, inserted "ratites" in Subsection C.  
The 1991 amendment, effective June 14, 1991, deleted "or, when delegated authority by the secretary, the director of the property tax division of the department" at the end of Subsection B; added Subsection D; redesignated former Subsections D to O as Subsections E to P; deleted "as defined in Section 66-1-4 NMSA 1978" following "manufactured homes" near the beginning of Subsection J; and added the language beginning "and, except for" at the end of Subsection K.  
The property tax division's conclusion that elk are not livestock is a reasonable interpretation of this section. Had the legislature intended for the word "livestock" to be given identical treatment under the Livestock Code and the Property Tax Code, it would have been a simple matter for it to have given the term identical definitions. Jicarilla Apache Nation v. Rodarte, 2004-NMSC-035, 136 N.M. 630, 103 P.3d 554.  
Vendor is an "owner". — Because a vendor holds legal title and because the Property Tax Code defines "owner" as the holder of any title, the vendor under a real estate contract is an "owner" under the code. Southwest Land Inv., Inc. v. Hubbart, 1993-NMSC-072, 116 N.M. 742, 867 P.2d 412.

7-35-6. Suspension of county assessor's functions; department's performance of county assessor's functions. 
A. If the secretary finds after informal efforts to obtain compliance have failed that a county assessor is not complying with the Property Tax Code or with the regulations, orders, rulings or other administrative directives of the department under the Property Tax Code, the secretary shall notify the county assessor and the board of county commissioners of the county involved by certified mail of the noncompliance and of the action required to remedy the noncompliance.  
B. If the failure has not been remedied within sixty days after the notice is mailed, the secretary shall issue an order requiring the county assessor and the board of county commissioners to show cause why the county assessor's functions should not be suspended. The secretary shall set a time and place for a hearing on the order and shall send by certified mail to the county assessor and to the board of county commissioners copies of the order and the notice of hearings.  
C. If the secretary determines after a hearing that a county assessor has failed to comply with the Property Tax Code or regulations, orders, rulings or instructions of the department or of the department of finance and administration pursuant to the Property Tax Code, the secretary may suspend in whole or in part any of the county assessor's functions. The suspension shall be by written order of the secretary and shall continue until the secretary finds that the county assessor is both willing and able to comply with the Property Tax Code and the regulations, orders, rulings or instructions of the department or of the department of finance and administration pursuant to the Property Tax Code.  
D. During a suspension, the department succeeds to and shall carry out the functions from which the county assessor has been suspended. The county shall reimburse the department for all costs incurred in performing the functions. In the event that the county does not make reimbursement within a reasonable time, the department, notwithstanding any other provision of law, may obtain reimbursement by retaining ten percent of each distribution or transfer required by law to be made to the county from money collected by the department until the total retained equals the amount to be reimbursed. All amounts received or retained by the department under this subsection are appropriated to the department for its use in carrying out its duties under the Property Tax Code.  
E. No less than thirty days after the date of any suspension order, the board of county commissioners may make a written request to the secretary to terminate the suspension order on the grounds that it is no longer justified because of the county assessor's willingness and ability to comply with the Property Tax Code or regulations, 
orders, rulings or instructions of the department or of the department of finance and administration pursuant to the Property Tax Code. Upon receipt of a request to terminate a suspension order, the secretary shall set a time and place for a hearing on the request. The date of the hearing shall be not more than thirty days after the receipt of the request, and the secretary shall notify the board of county commissioners and the county assessor of the time and place of the hearing by certified mail. If the secretary determines after a hearing that the county assessor is both willing and able to comply with the Property Tax Code and the regulations, orders, rulings or instructions of the department or of the department of finance and administration pursuant to the Property Tax Code, the secretary shall terminate the suspension by written order, which order must be made within ten days of the hearing. In the absence of such a finding, the secretary shall deny the request for termination of the suspension, which denial must be made by written order within ten days of the hearing. Nothing in this subsection prohibits the secretary from terminating an order of suspension issued in accordance with Subsection C of this section without a request for a hearing, or a hearing, on the issue of termination of suspension. Repeated requests for the termination of a suspension may be made, but no request may be made less than thirty days after the date of the secretary's denial of a previous request for termination of a suspension.

7-36-2. Allocation of responsibility for valuation and determining classification of property for property taxation purposes; county assessor and department. 
A. The county assessor is responsible and has the authority for the valuation of all property subject to valuation for property taxation purposes in the county except the property specified by Subsections B and C of this section.  
B. The department is responsible and has the authority for the valuation of all property subject to valuation for property taxation purposes and used in the conduct of the following businesses:  
(1) railroad;  
(2) communications system as that term is defined in Section 7-36-30 NMSA 1978;  
(3) pipeline;  
(4) public utility; and  
(5) airline.  
C. The department is responsible and has the authority for the valuation of property subject to valuation for property taxation purposes when that property is:  
(1) an electricity generating plant, whether or not owned by a public utility, if all or part of the electricity is generated for ultimate sale to the consuming public;  
(2) mineral property and property held or used in connection with mineral property as defined in Sections 7-36-22 through 7-36-25 NMSA 1978; or  
(3) machinery, equipment and other personal property of all resident and nonresident persons customarily engaged in construction that involves the use during a tax year of the machinery, equipment and other personal property in more than one county. For the purposes of this paragraph, "construction" means leveling or clearing land, excavating earth, drilling wells of any type, including seismograph shot holes or core drilling, or similar work, or building, altering, repairing or demolishing any:  
(a) road, highway, bridge, parking area or related project;  
(b) building, fence, stadium or other structure;  
(c) airport, subway or similar facility;

E. The secretary by regulation may delegate authority to the county assessor for the valuation and classification of property subject to valuation for property taxation purposes for which the department is responsible pursuant to Subsections B through D of this section only if:  
(1) the property is held or used in connection with the transmission, storage, measurement or distribution of water and the transmission, storage, measurement and distribution is conducted by a single person entirely within a single county; or  
(2) the property is held or used in connection with a communications system as defined in Section 7-36-30 NMSA 1978 and the system operates entirely within a single county.

Different tax treatment based on use of contractor's equipment unconstitutional. — Since the effect of former 7-36-9 NMSA 1978 and 72-6-4A(1)(c), 1953 Comp. (predecessor of this section), was that contractors whose machinery and equipment was used in more than one county were subject to property tax on sales inventories, and contractors whose machinery and equipment was not used in more than one county were not subject to property tax on sales inventories, this difference in tax treatment based solely on whether a contractor uses his equipment in more than one county was arbitrary and resulted in a denial of equal protection of the law; therefore, to the extent that valuation by the property appraisal department deprives the taxpayer of the exemption in former 7-36-9 NMSA 1978, that section is unconstitutional. Halliburton Co. v. Property Appraisal Dep't, 1975-NMCA-123, 88 N.M. 476, 542 P.2d 56.  
Use of equipment in multiple counties cannot be defended on basis of administrative convenience. — A classification based solely on the use of machinery and equipment in more than one county is patently unreasonable, and cannot be defended on the basis of assessment procedures. Administrative convenience in arriving at a valuation of the property involved does not show a rational basis for taxing inventories of contractors who report value to the property appraisal department rather than to the county assessor. The fact that taxpayers may reasonably be required to report their property values to different government offices because of differences in geographic operations does not provide a reasonable basis for a difference in tax treatment on the values reported. Halliburton Co. v. Property Appraisal Dep't, 1975-NMCA-123, 88 N.M. 476, 542 P.2d 56.

Director, not court, to choose between conflicting inferences. — Decision of the director supported by substantial evidence that taxpayer contractor's activities, which were performed prior to production from a well, in the usual course of business, involving the use of machinery and equipment commonly used in the course of drilling an oil and gas well came within 72-6-4A(1)(c), 1953 Comp. (now Section 7-36-2C(3) NMSA 1978), was affirmed since although there was conflicting evidence and it was for the director to choose between conflicting inferences. Halliburton Co. v. Prop. Appraisal Dep't, 1975-NMCA-123, 88 N.M. 476, 542 P.2d 56.  
Use of machinery and equipment sufficient. — Section 72-6-4A(1)(c), 1953 Comp. (now Section 7-36-2C(3) NMSA 1978), by its terms, did not require a company to be the drilling contractor; the contractor's work must involve the use of, but not be limited to, machinery and equipment commonly used in oil and gas well drilling.

Valuation of livestock. — Subsection D of Section 7-36-21 NMSA 1978 does not allocate valuation of livestock responsibility to the division (department); instead, that section simply requires the division (department) to supervise the assessor by establishing classes of livestock and values for those classes of livestock. While the division (department) must establish general criteria for valuing livestock, the county assessor does the actual valuation. Zwaagstra v. DelCurto, 1992-NMCA-087, 114 N.M. 263, 837 P.2d 457.  
Department found in contempt for failing to value and assess high-voltage transmission lines for property taxes. — Where petitioners petitioned for a writ of mandamus to compel the New Mexico taxation and revenue department (department) 
to establish values for two high-voltage transmission lines in Harding county and report those values to the Harding county assessor so that property taxes could be assessed on the lines, and where the district court issued the peremptory writ, determining that the transmission lines were taxable, and ordered the department to complete the valuation processes for the two transmission lines, timely conclude any protests, and certify the values to the county assessor for preparation of a bill for the property tax due, and where, following an administrative hearing officer's conclusion that the transmission lines did not have any value for tax assessment purposes, the department certified that the transmission were not taxable, which was contrary to the district court's order, and certified to the district court that the department complied with the court's order, and where petitioners then filed a motion for an order to show cause, arguing that the department had not complied with the peremptory writ, the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding the department in contempt and in awarding petitioners attorney fees as sanctions, because the department admittedly failed to act in accordance with the dictates of the law after the district court ordered the department to act and after the department was given notice and an opportunity to be heard.

A. Property interests of a lessee in project property held under a lease from a county or a municipality under authority of an industrial revenue bond or pollution control revenue bond act, the Statewide Economic Development Finance Act [Chapter 6, Article 25 NMSA 1978] or the Regional Air Center Special Economic District Act [5-20-1 to 5-20-10 NMSA 1978] are exempt from property taxation for as long as there is an outstanding bonded indebtedness under the terms of the revenue bonds issued for the acquisition of the project property, but in no event for a period of more than thirty years from the date of execution of the first lease of the project to the lessee by the county or municipality. 
B.

C.

Constitutional. — Constitutional guarantees of equal protection and uniform taxation are not violated by the provision of this section for a 75-year limitation on leases qualifying for exemption.

(a) this does not include property all or a part of the value of which is exempt because of the application of the veteran, disabled veteran or head-of-family exemption;  
(b) this provision does not excuse an owner from obligations to report the owner's property as required by regulation of the department adopted under Section 7-38-8.1 NMSA 1978 or to claim its exempt status under Subsection C of Section 7-38-17 NMSA 1978;

Assessor’s standing to raise the constitutionality of this section. — Where the Santa Fe county assessor appealed the district court’s decision that petitioner, a retirement and continuing care community, was improperly denied a charitable property tax exemption on the grounds that by meeting the plain language requirements of 7-36-7(B)(1)(d) NMSA 1978, petitioner had also fulfilled the charitable use requirements for tax exemption under art. VIII, § 3 of the New Mexico constitution, the county assessor had standing to challenge the constitutionality of 7-36-7(B)(1)(d) NMSA 1978, because a justiciable controversy existed with regard to petitioner’s claim of entitlement to a tax exemption and the county assessor is responsible and has the authority for the valuation of all property subject to valuation for property tax purposes. El Castillo Ret. Residences v. Martinez, 2017-NMSC-026, aff’g 2015-NMCA-041, and overruling La Vida Llena v. Montoya, 2013-NMCA-048, 299 P.3d 456.  
Constitutional limitation on the legislature’s power. — N.M. Const., art. VIII, § 3 operates as a limit on the legislature’s power to redefine categories of property which will be exempt from taxation, and 7-36-7(B)(1)(d) NMSA 1978 may not be interpreted or applied to grant exemptions that are not authorized by art. VIII, § 3. El Castillo Ret. Residences v. Martinez, 2017-NMSC-026, aff’g 2015-NMCA-041, and overruling La Vida Llena v. Montoya, 2013-NMCA-048, 299 P.3d 456.  
Where the Santa Fe county assessor appealed the district court’s decision that petitioner, a retirement and continuing care community, was improperly denied a charitable property tax exemption, the New Mexico supreme court held that the district court erred in concluding that petitioner fulfilled the charitable use requirements for tax exemption under art. VIII, § 3 of the New Mexico constitution, because petitioner, a self-sustaining community that accepts and benefits only financially and medically screened residents based on requirements calculated in the interests of financial security for itself, did not create any substantial public benefit and therefore cannot be entitled to exemption from taxation under 7-36-7(B)(1)(d) NMSA 1978 or N.M. Const., art. VIII, § 3. El Castillo Ret. Residences v. Martinez, 2017-NMSC-026, aff’g 2015-NMCA-041, and overruling La Vida Llena v. Montoya, 2013-NMCA-048, 299 P.3d 456.  
Department found in contempt for failing to value and assess high-voltage transmission lines for property taxes. — Where petitioners petitioned for a writ of mandamus to compel the New Mexico taxation and revenue department (department) to establish values for two high-voltage transmission lines in Harding county and report those values to the Harding county assessor so that property taxes could be assessed on the lines, and where the district court issued the peremptory writ, determining that the transmission lines were taxable, and ordered the department to complete the valuation processes for the two transmission lines, timely conclude any protests, and certify the values to the county assessor for preparation of a bill for the property tax due, and where, following an administrative hearing officer's conclusion that the transmission lines did not have any value for tax assessment purposes, the department certified that the transmission lines were not taxable, which was contrary to the district court's order, and certified to the district court that the department complied with the court's order, and where petitioners then filed a motion for an order to show cause, arguing that the department had not complied with the peremptory writ, the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding the department in contempt and in awarding petitioners attorney fees as sanctions, because the department admittedly failed to act in accordance with the dictates of the law after the district court ordered the department to act and after the department was given notice and an opportunity to be heard.  Harding Cnty. Bd. of Comm'rs v. N.M. Tax'n & Revenue Dep't, 2021-NMSC-007, aff'g A-1-CA-36305, mem. op. (May 24, 2019) (nonprecedential). 
Property operated under the Continuing Care Act. — Section 7-36-7(B)(1)(d) NMSA 1978 does not require a minimum amount of donated or gratuitously rendered services or facilities for charitable purposes in order for a continuing care facility to receive the property tax exemption. La Vida Llena v. Montoya, 2013-NMCA-048, 299 P.3d 456.  
Where protestant operated a continuing care facility pursuant to the Continuing Care Act, Section 24-17-1 NMSA 1978 et seq., had been granted an exemption from federal taxes, used all funds remaining after payment of its usual and necessary expenses of operation to further its charitable purpose, provided services to some medicare residents when the cost of their care exceeded medicare reimbursement, permitted its staff time to serve other charitable organizations, provided services for its foundation, and did not terminate resident agreements when residents did not pay, protestant donated or rendered gratuitously some part of its facilities and services for charitable services and was entitled to receive the property tax exemption. La Vida Llena v. Montoya, 2013-NMCA-048, 299 P.3d 456.  
Property to provide educational services. — Property devoted primarily and substantially to traditional museum functions of: (1) the preservation and exhibition of significant aspects, artifacts, and works of our lives and history for the benefit of the general public's appreciation, study, and knowledge; and (2) the carrying on of museum-related educational programs and activities such as lectures, studies, publishing scholarly materials, and creating instructional materials, is property with uses and purposes that ought to be considered for educational purposes tax exemption 
pursuant to the state constitution. Georgia O'Keefe Museum v. County of Santa Fe, 2003-NMCA-003, 133 N.M. 297, 62 P.3d 754.  
To qualify for the educational purposes tax exemption, a museum must adhere to a systematic approach to learning. This requires an ordered, methodical, structured, and regular learning opportunity provided by the museum owner whose primary goal and major purpose through the museum is to impart knowledge and information in order to educate the public in respect to a branch of learning and it requires substantial public benefit. Georgia O'Keefe Museum v. County of Santa Fe, 2003-NMCA-003, 133 N.M. 297, 62 P.3d 754.  
Indian lands and property exempt. — New Mexico Const., art. XXI, § 2, clearly precludes state from taxing Indian lands and Indian property on the reservation. Prince v. Board of Educ., 1975-NMSC-068, 88 N.M. 548, 543 P.2d 1176.  
Private non-Indian corporations cannot escape obligation to pay state taxes by locating their property on Indian reservations. Nothing forbids the imposition of such a tax, since it does not in any way infringe on the right of reservation Indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them. Prince v. Board of Educ., 1975-NMSC-068, 88 N.M. 548, 543 P.2d 1176.  
State may tax property of corporation leasing land from Indian tribe. — Nothing prevents New Mexico from imposing a tax on the property of non-Indian corporations leasing land from the Navajo tribe, despite the fact that the property might be located on the reservation, because although the land itself cannot be taxed, the non-Indian property, which does not belong to and may not be acquired by the United States or reserved for its use, can. As private property owned by non-Indians who are not performing a federal function, it is subject to the taxing powers of this state. Prince v. Board of Educ., 1975-NMSC-068, 88 N.M. 548, 543 P.2d 1176.  
Lease to construct housing on federal land subject to tax. — Congress having explicitly removed the bar of sovereign immunity as it applied to property belonging to the United States, the immunity granted the federal government by N.M. Const., art. VIII, § 3, and art. XXI, § 2, clearly was not available to one who had lease to construct military housing on federal land. It was his interest that was subject to taxation.

(a) that is used, produced, manufactured, held for sale, leased or maintained by a person for purposes of the person's profession, business or occupation; and

Department found in contempt for failing to value and assess high-voltage transmission lines for property taxes. — Where petitioners petitioned for a writ of mandamus to compel the New Mexico taxation and revenue department (department) to establish values for two high-voltage transmission lines in Harding county and report those values to the Harding county assessor so that property taxes could be assessed on the lines, and where the district court issued the peremptory writ, determining that the transmission lines were taxable, and ordered the department to complete the valuation processes for the two transmission lines, timely conclude any protests, and certify the values to the county assessor for preparation of a bill for the property tax due, and where, following an administrative hearing officer's conclusion that the transmission lines did not have any value for tax assessment purposes, the department certified that the transmission lines were not taxable, which was contrary to the district court's order, and certified to the district court that the department complied with the court's order, and where petitioners then filed a motion for an order to show cause, arguing that the department had not complied with the peremptory writ, the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding the department in contempt and in awarding petitioners attorney fees as sanctions, because the department admittedly failed to act in accordance with the dictates of the law after the district court ordered the department to act and after the department was given notice and an opportunity to be heard.

7-36-15. Methods of valuation for property taxation purposes; general provisions. 
A. Property subject to valuation for property taxation purposes under this article of the Property Tax Code shall be valued by the methods required by this article of the Property Tax Code whether the determination of value is made by the department or the county assessor. The same or similar methods of valuation shall be used for valuation of the same or similar kinds of property for property taxation purposes.  
B. Unless a method or methods of valuation are authorized in Sections 7-36-20 through 7-36-33 NMSA 1978, the value of property for property taxation purposes shall be its market value as determined by application of the sales of comparable property, income or cost methods of valuation or any combination of these methods. In using any of the methods of valuation authorized by this subsection, the valuation authority:  
(1) shall apply generally accepted appraisal techniques; and  
(2) in determining the market value of residential housing, shall consider any decrease in the value that would be realized by the owner in a sale of the property because of the effects of any affordable housing subsidy, covenant or encumbrance imposed pursuant to a federal, state or local affordable housing program that restricts the future use of the property or the resale price of the property or would otherwise prohibit the owner from fully benefitting from any enhanced value of the property. As used in this paragraph:  
(a) "subsidy, covenant or encumbrance imposed pursuant to a federal, state or local affordable housing program" includes those imposed by a nonprofit entity approved by a governmental entity as a qualifying grantee pursuant to the Affordable Housing Act [6-27-1 to 6-27-8 NMSA 1978]; and  
(b) "residential housing" means any building, structure or portion thereof that is primarily occupied, or designed or intended primarily for occupancy, as a residence by one or more households and any real property that is offered for sale or lease for the construction or location thereon of such a building, structure or portion thereof. "Residential housing" includes congregate housing, manufactured homes, housing intended to provide or providing transitional or temporary housing for homeless persons and common health care, kitchen, dining, recreational and other facilities primarily for use by residents of a residential housing project.  
C. Dams, reservoirs, tanks, canals, irrigation wells, installed irrigation pumps, stock-watering wells and pumps, similar structures and equipment used for irrigation or stock-watering purposes, water rights and private roads shall not be valued separately from the land they serve. The foregoing improvements and rights shall be considered as appurtenances to the land they serve, and their value shall be included in the determination of value of the land.  
D. The department shall adopt regulations to implement the methods of valuation authorized in this article of the Property Tax Code.

I. GENERAL CONSIDERATION. 
Exclusive reliance on evidence of prior year comparable sales was reasonable. — With respect to comparable sales, the legislature intended assessors and protests boards to consider only data available on January 1 of the tax year of the valuation notice. AMREP Sw., Inc. v. Sandoval Cnty. Assessor, 2012-NMCA-082, 284 P.3d 1118.  
Where the county valuation protests board refused to consider the taxpayer’s comparable 2009 sales evidence and relied exclusively on comparable 2008 sales for the valuation of the taxpayer’s property for the 2009 tax year based on the board’s interpretation of statutory and administrative code provisions that required property to be valued using only data available on January 1, 2009, the board’s interpretation of the 
statutory and administrative code provisions was reasonable. AMREP Sw., Inc. v. Sandoval Cnty. Assessor, 2012-NMCA-082, 284 P.3d 1118.  
Assessor's valuation sufficient evidence. — Since the assessor's valuation is presumed to be correct it is sufficient evidence, where uncontradicted, to support the board's decision. Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.  
How presumption of assessor's valuation may be overcome. — The statutory presumption of correctness of the value of property by the county assessor for tax purposes can be overcome by a taxpayer showing that the assessor did not follow the applicable statutory provisions, or by presenting evidence tending to dispute the factual correctness of the valuation. La Jara Land Developers, Inc. v. Bernalillo Cnty. Assessor, 1982-NMCA-006, 97 N.M. 318, 639 P.2d 605.  
Admission of taxpayer's evidence when market value indeterminable. — The protests board could not rely exclusively on the county assessor's valuation of property even though, according to 72-2-3, 1953 Comp., the assessment must be at "full actual value," and neither could it rely on comparable sales or sales of comparable lands where none have occurred; accordingly, the board should have allowed the admission of the only available relevant evidence which the taxpayer had. In situations where cash market value could not be determined, earning capacity, cost of reproduction and original cost less depreciation furnished relevant considerations for determining "value." In re Miller, 1975-NMCA-116, 88 N.M. 492, 542 P.2d 1182, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70, rev'd on other grounds, 89 N.M. 547, 555 P.2d 142 (1976) (decided under prior law).  
Presumption of assessor's valuation not overcome. — Since taxpayer failed to present any evidence of sales of comparable property or evidence of value based on generally accepted appraisal techniques, and its only evidence, the purchase price of its land in question, did not establish a market value under Subsection B, the presumption of the correctness of the assessor's valuation was not overcome. Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.  
Presumption of assessor's valuation not overcome. — The presumption of the correctness of the assessor's valuation was not overcome by the taxpayers' offer, as evidence of market value, the price for which they purchased the property, where the sales price was not the result of an arms'-length transaction because of the taxpayers' mailing campaign to convince landowners to sell their property to the taxpayers at below market prices. In re Cobb, 1991-NMCA-122, 113 N.M. 251, 824 P.2d 1053, cert. denied, 113 N.M. 44, 822 P.2d 1127 (1992).  
Taxpayer rebutted presumption of assessor's valuation. — Since taxpayers presented uncontradicted evidence that access to their property was physically blocked and also offered the only substantial evidence of the fair market value of the property in the form of testimony by a real estate appraiser that because of the lack of access the 
highest and best use that the property could be put to was as grazing land by one of the adjoining landowners, and that as such it had a fair market value of $18.00 per acre, or $2034 and $5022 respectively for the two tracts, they effectively rebutted the presumption of 7-38-6 NMSA 1978 that the county assessor's valuations of $313,875 and $169,500 were correct. Petition of Kinscherff, 1976-NMCA-097, 89 N.M. 669, 556 P.2d 355, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 8, 558 P.2d 620.  
When county assessor did not follow any statutory method of valuation in 1976, but simply set the valuation of a shopping center back up to the 1972 figure, the decisions of the board were arbitrary and capricious, not supported by substantial evidence in the record taken as a whole, and otherwise not in accordance with law, and its orders were vacated. San Pedro S. Group v. Bernalillo Cnty. Valuation Protest Bd., 1976-NMCA-116, 89 N.M. 784, 558 P.2d 53.  
Scope of "structures and equipment" in Subsection C. — The inclusion of Subsection C indicated that the exemption from separate valuation for the structures and equipment listed in Subsection C is not limited to structures and equipment used for the purposes of irrigation or stock-watering, but applies to all such structures and equipment. Kerr-McGee Nuclear Corp. v. Property Tax Div., 1980-NMCA-063, 95 N.M. 685, 625 P.2d 1202.  
No denial of due process in failure to adopt regulations. — Taxpayer was not denied due process because the property tax department did not adopt regulations that listed the procedures to be followed, and identified the methods of valuation in general use by the department and the applicable factors to be included in determining the value of property, since the amended statute did not require regulations, and taxpayer had the right of discovery by deposition of all the facts necessary to defend the assessed valuation of its property. Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.  
Failure to require equalization does not establish official interpretation. — The fact that state officials have, for years, known that there are inequalities or lack of uniformity in tax assessments and have done nothing about it does not establish this as official "long-standing interpretation." It is, in essence, merely long-standing failure by respondents and their predecessors to require equalization as plainly required by the constitution and the legislative enactments. State ex rel. Castillo Corp. v. N.M. Tax Comm'n, 1968-NMSC-117, 79 N.M. 357, 443 P.2d 850.  
Honest judgment most important. — What is most important is that the appraisers, the assessor and the protest board exercise an honest judgment based upon the information they possess or are able to acquire. First Nat'l Bank v. Bernalillo Cnty. Valuation Protest Bd., 1977-NMCA-005, 90 N.M. 110, 560 P.2d 174.  
Sovereign immunity not applicable in mandamus of assessment ratio. — In a mandamus proceeding to require the performance of a duty plainly required under the constitution, i.e., to prescribe an assessment ratio so that property shall be uniformly 
assessed in proportion to its value, the sovereign immunity doctrine is not applicable. State ex rel. Castillo Corp. v. N.M. Tax Comm'n, 1968-NMSC-117, 79 N.M. 357, 443 P.2d 850.  
II. MARKET VALUE. 
A. IN GENERAL. 
"Market value" means a price which a purchaser, willing but not obliged to buy, would pay an owner, willing but not obliged to sell, taking into consideration all uses to which the property is adapted and might in reason be applied. Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.  
Usual factors which are considered in ascertaining fair market value of any given tract of land are its size, shape, location, topography, accessibility to roads, availability of public utilities and comparable sales, and, in a given instance, one factor may far outweigh all the rest in importance. Petition of Kinscherff, 1976-NMCA-097, 89 N.M. 669, 556 P.2d 355, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 8, 558 P.2d 620.  
Legislature gave priority to first method of valuation, a valuation determined by sales of comparable property. It did not do so with reference to the succeeding methods. If the legislature intended to give priority to the second method, the "income method," over the third method, the "cost method," for any reason, it would have phrased the section in language similar to the priority established in the first method of valuation. First Nat'l Bank v. Bernalillo Cnty. Valuation Protest Bd., 1977-NMCA-005, 90 N.M. 110, 560 P.2d 174.  
Proof of purchase price alone is not sufficient to fix market value without evidence of the details of the sale. Cobb v. Otero Cnty. Assessor, 1983-NMCA-090, 100 N.M. 207, 668 P.2d 323.  
Market value not an absolute. — Subsection B makes it clear that market value is not a given or an absolute, it is only a method of determining value. National Potash Co. v. Property Tax Div., 1984-NMCA-055, 101 N.M. 404, 683 P.2d 521.  
Explanation necessary when market value not used for valuation. — If market value is not used as the basis for calculating assessed valuation, the assessor must explain why that approach is not appropriate, or that there is a lack of adequate market data. Protest of Plaza Del Sol Ltd. P'ship v. Assessor for Cnty. of Bernalillo, 1986-NMCA-022, 104 N.M. 154, 717 P.2d 1123.  
Past or future value not to serve as basis. — What the fair market value of a tract may have been in the past or speculation as to what it might be in the future cannot serve as the basis for valuation. Petition of Kinscherff, 1976-NMCA-097, 89 N.M. 669, 556 P.2d 355, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 8, 558 P.2d 620; Bakel v. Bernalillo Cnty. Assessor, 1980-NMCA-173, 95 N.M. 723, 625 P.2d 1240.  
Past market value. — Evidence of what the fair market value of a tract may have been in the past cannot properly be utilized as the sole basis for valuation of the property for tax purposes. La Jara Land Developers, Inc. v. Bernalillo Cnty. Assessor, 1982-NMCA-006, 97 N.M. 318, 639 P.2d 605.  
Use of mass appraisal method upheld. — The use by the county assessor of the mass appraisal methodology to value plaintiffs' undeveloped property for tax assessment purposes was permissible under this statute when the method was based on standard appraisal procedure, such as comparable sales, and the resulting valuation bore a reasonable relationship to the market value. In re Cobb, 1991-NMCA-122, 113 N.M. 251, 824 P.2d 1053, cert. denied, 113 N.M. 44, 822 P.2d 1127.  
Using one uniform percentage depreciation factor for property valuation improper. — Any property valuation method which uses one uniform percentage depreciation factor, regardless of the age of the property, is an improper method of determining property value; such a method would not, except by mere coincidence, yield a value consistent with the fair market value of the property. Anaconda Co. v. Prop. Tax Dep't, 1979-NMCA-158, 94 N.M. 202, 608 P.2d 514, cert. denied, 94 N.M. 628, 614 P.2d 545.  
Insufficient evidence to support county assessor’s method of valuation. — Where appellant sought review of the Bernalillo county valuation protests board’s valuation of appellant’s commercial property, and where the county assessor testified that the assessor applies a forty-five percent limitation on operating expenses rather than applying the taxpayer’s actual reported expenses, but absent data that forty-five percent is an appropriate limitation on operating expenses in this market, for this property type, and during this time period, there was insufficient evidence such that a reasonable person could conclude that the county assessor’s application of the income valuation method utilized generally accepted appraisal techniques. 2727 San Pedro LLC v. Bernalillo Cty. Assessor, 2017-NMCA-008.  
B. COMPARABLE SALES METHOD. 
"Comparable property" is property similar to the property being appraised, which has been recently sold or is currently being offered for sale in the same or competing areas. Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074; New Mexico Baptist Found. v. Bernalillo Cnty. Assessor, 1979-NMCA-102, 93 N.M. 363, 600 P.2d 309.  
"Comparable" is defined as capable of being compared with, worthy of comparison, and thus must necessarily include dissimilarities as well as similarities. Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.  
"To compare". — In reviewing sales of other properties, "to compare" means to examine the characteristics or qualities of one or more properties for the purpose of 
discovering their resemblances or differences; the aim is to show relative values by bringing out characteristic qualities, whether similar or divergent, and thus, comparisons based on sales may be made according to location, age and condition of improvements, income and expense, use, size, type of construction and in numerous other ways. Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.  
Best method is use of comparable sales. — The best method of ascertaining what a willing and informed buyer would pay a willing and informed seller in usual circumstances in light of the highest and best use to which the property may be put in the not too distant future is through the use of comparable sales. Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.  
Reasonable cash market value, reflected by comparable property sales, is relevant for determining the correct valuation of a piece of property, if there have been such sales. Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.  
When comparable sales evidence not presented. — Since the documents relied upon by a taxpayer as evidence of comparable sales are documents dealing with the sale of that very improvement whose valuation is the subject of the present dispute and the only evidence submitted by the taxpayer is the purchase price of the land in question, the taxpayer failed to present any evidence of sales of comparable property and the evidence submitted does not establish a market value under Subsection B and the statutory presumption of correctness of valuation for tax purposes still stands. N.M. Baptist Found. v. Bernalillo Cnty. Assessor, 1979-NMCA-102, 93 N.M. 363, 600 P.2d 309.  
Test of comparable sales relevancy left to court's discretion. — The rule regarding comparable sales is one of relevancy and, not unlike the general evidentiary rule applied in all proceedings, requiring similarity of conditions. The test is usually left to the discretion of the court in light of the circumstances of each case. Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.  
C. INCOME OR COST METHOD. 
When income or cost method of valuation utilized. — Since, if reliable comparable sales data can be reasonably obtained, the comparable sales method must be used, the taxpayer has the burden to demonstrate either that comparable sales data is not reasonably obtainable or that it would be unreliable. To demonstrate a lack of reliability, the taxpayer might show that the location, access, utilities or other such factors distinguish his property from other such properties. If the taxpayer is able to show that the comparable sales method should not be utilized, then the income method or cost method must be used. Bakel v. Bernalillo Cnty. Assessor, 1980-NMCA-173, 95 N.M. 723, 625 P.2d 1240.  
Methods of valuation. — If the "cost method" or "income method" is employed as the primary mode of ascertaining the value of property for tax purposes, the appraiser must determine that there is a lack of comparable sales data precluding utilization of the first method of valuation and support this determination by substantial evidence. La Jara Land Developers, Inc. v. Bernalillo Cnty. Assessor, 1982-NMCA-006, 97 N.M. 318, 639 P.2d 605.  
Income method inapplicable to agricultural land. — By its plain terms, the income method set forth in this section does not apply to land classified as agricultural. Agricultural land is to be valued based on its capacity to produce, not on its actual production. Jicarilla Apache Nation v. Rio Arriba Cnty. Assessor, 2004-NMCA-055, 135 N.M. 630, 92 P.3d 642, rev'd, 2004-NMSC-035, 136 N.M. 630, 103 P.3d 554.  
III. EVIDENCE. 
Taxing authority may rely on any relevant evidence. — In assessing property for taxation the taxing authority may rely on any evidence that is relevant. Assessor's evidence of a sale of a smaller tract of land in the same vicinity was substantial and supported the board's decision. Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.  
Relevant evidence includes that of ratios of assessed value to market value. — To arrive at uniformity in the assessment of property for taxation, as provided in N.M. Const., art. VIII, §§ 1 and 2, the taxing authority and the taxpayer can introduce evidence regarding the ratios of assessed values to market values as the latter are reflected in actual sales of any other real estate in the taxing district for a reasonable period prior to the assessment date. Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.  
No denial of due process in exclusion of irrelevant evidence. — Since former Subsection B of this section fixed two methods of determining market value, namely sales of comparable property and the application of generally accepted appraisal techniques, taxpayer's offer of evidence of a valuation of comparable property was not relevant and exclusion of such evidence did not deny taxpayer of due process. Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.  
Appraiser's acceptance of hearsay destroys weight of his opinions. — An expert appraiser's blanket acceptance of hearsay information and his failure to consider influencing facts in so-called "comparable sales" all but destroys any weight that might be given to his opinions. Four Hills Country Club v. Bernalillo Cnty. Property Tax Protest Bd., 1979-NMCA-141, 94 N.M. 709, 616 P.2d 422.  
Section does not give taxpayers right to determine method of valuation, but gives the county assessor the right to use either the "income method or cost methods of 
valuation." First Nat'l Bank v. Bernalillo Cnty. Valuation Protest Bd., 1977-NMCA-005, 90 N.M. 110, 560 P.2d 174.  
Taxpayer has right to discover method of valuation used and has a right to discovery similar in scope to that granted by Rules 26 to 37 of the Rules of Civil Procedure. First Nat'l Bank v. Bernalillo Cnty. Valuation Protest Bd., 1977-NMCA-005, 90 N.M. 110, 560 P.2d 174.

Except as limited in Section 7-36-21.2 NMSA 1978, they shall also implement a program of updating property values so that current and correct values of property are maintained and shall have sole responsibility and authority at the county level for property valuation maintenance, subject only to the general supervisory powers of the director.  
B. The director shall implement a program of regular evaluation of county assessors' valuation activities with particular emphasis on the maintenance of current and correct values.  
C. Upon request of the county assessor, the director may contract with a board of county commissioners for the department to assume all or part of the responsibilities, functions and authority of a county assessor to establish or operate a property valuation maintenance program in the county. The contract shall be in writing and shall include provisions for the sharing of the program costs between the county and the department. The contract must include specific descriptions of the objectives to be reached and the tasks to be performed by the contracting parties. The initial term of any contract authorized under this subsection shall not extend beyond the end of the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which it is executed, but contracts may be renewed for additional one-year periods for succeeding years.  
D. The department of finance and administration shall not approve the operating budget of any county in which there is not an adequate allocation of funds to the county assessor for the purpose of fulfilling his responsibilities for property valuation maintenance under this section. If the department of finance and administration questions the adequacy of any allocation of funds for this purpose, it shall consult with the department, the board of county commissioners and the county assessor in making its determination of adequacy.  
E. To aid the board of county commissioners in determining whether a county assessor is operating an efficient program of property valuation maintenance and in determining the amount to be allocated to him for this function, the county assessor shall present with his annual budget request a written report setting forth improvements of property added to valuation records during the year, additions of new property to valuation records during the year, increases and decreases of valuation during the year, the relationship of sales prices of property sold to values of the property for property taxation purposes and the current status of the overall property valuation maintenance program in the county. The county assessor shall send a copy of this report to the department.

Value is a matter of opinion, and, when the law has provided officers upon whom the duty is imposed to make the valuation, it is the opinion of those officers to which the interests of the parties are referred. The court cannot sit in judgment upon their errors, or substitute its own opinion for the conclusions the officers of the law have reached.

County property valuation fund. — In creating the county property valuation fund in 7-38-38.1C NMSA 1978, the legislature created a permanent source of additional revenue to assist county assessors in fulfilling their statutory obligations to maintain current and correct values of all property within their jurisdictions, and directed county assessors to 
use those funds to achieve fair and timely reappraisal programs. The legislation does not impose any restrictions on the use of the funds other than the use be part of a property valuation program presented by the county assessor and approved by the county commission. Robinson v. Board of Comm’rs of the Cty. of Eddy, 2015-NMSC-035.  
Where the Eddy county assessor sought to use funds from the county property valuation fund, 7-38-38.1C NMSA 1978, to contract with a private company for technical assistance in locating and valuing oil and gas property within Eddy county, the Eddy county commission was not prohibited from approving a contract with an independent contractor to assist the county assessor in valuing property, because the legislature, in creating the county property valuation fund, made no attempt to restrict an assessor’s discretion on the use of the fund and thus intended to leave it to the professional discretion of county assessors to decide how best to achieve the statutory goal of current and correct valuation of all property within the county. Robinson v. Board of Comm’rs of the Cty. of Eddy, 2015-NMSC-035.

7-36-20. Special method of valuation; land used primarily for agricultural purposes. 
A. The value of land used primarily for agricultural purposes shall be determined on the basis of the land's capacity to produce agricultural products. Evidence of bona fide primary agricultural use of land for the tax year preceding the year for which determination is made of eligibility for the land to be valued under this section creates a presumption that the land is used primarily for agricultural purposes during the tax year in which the determination is made. If the land was valued under this section in one or more of the three tax years preceding the year in which the determination is made and the use of the land has not changed since the most recent valuation under this section, a presumption is created that the land continues to be entitled to that valuation.  
B. For the purpose of this section:  
(1) "agricultural products" means plants, crops, trees, forest products, orchard crops, livestock, poultry, captive deer or elk, or fish; and  
(2) "agricultural use" means the:  
(a) use of land for the production of agricultural products;  
(b) use of land that meets the requirements for payment or other compensation pursuant to a soil conservation program under an agreement with an agency of the federal government;  
(c) resting of land to maintain its capacity to produce agricultural products; or  
(d) resting of land as the direct result of at least moderate drought conditions as designated by the United States department of agriculture, if the drought conditions occurred in the county within which the land is located for at least eight consecutive weeks during the previous tax year; provided that the land was used in the tax year immediately preceding the previous tax year primarily for a purpose identified pursuant to this paragraph.  
C. The department shall adopt rules for determining whether land is used primarily for agricultural purposes. The rules shall provide that the use of land for the lawful taking of game shall not be considered in determining whether land is used primarily for agricultural purposes.  
D. The department shall adopt rules for determining the value of land used primarily for agricultural purposes. The rules shall:  
(1) specify procedures to use in determining the capacity of land to produce agricultural products and the derivation of value of the land based upon its production capacity;  
(2) establish carrying capacity as the measurement of the production capacity of land used for grazing purposes, develop a system of determining carrying capacity through the use of an animal unit concept and establish carrying capacities for the land in the state classified as grazing land;  
(3) provide that land the bona fide and primary use of which is the production of captive deer or elk shall be valued as grazing land and that captive deer shall be valued and taxed as sheep and captive elk shall be valued and taxed as cattle;  
(4) provide for the consideration of determinations of any other governmental agency concerning the capacity of the same or similar lands to produce agricultural products;  
(5) assure that land determined under the rules to have the same or similar production capacity shall be valued uniformly throughout the state; and  
(6) provide for the periodic review by the department of determined production capacities and capitalization rates used for determining annually the value of land used primarily for agricultural purposes.  
E. All improvements, other than those specified in Section 7-36-15 NMSA 1978, on land used primarily for agricultural purposes shall be valued separately for property taxation purposes, and the value of these improvements shall be added to the value of the land determined under this section.  
F. The owner of the land shall make application to the county assessor in a tax year in which the valuation method of this section is first claimed to be applicable to the land or in a tax year immediately subsequent to a tax year in which the land was not valued under this section. Application shall be made under oath, shall be in a form and contain the information required by department rules and shall be made no later than thirty days after the date of mailing by the assessor of the notice of valuation. Once land is valued under this section, application need not be made in subsequent tax years as long as there is no change in the use of the land.  
G. The owner of land valued under this section shall report to the county assessor whenever the use of the land changes so that it is no longer being used primarily for agricultural purposes. This report shall be made on a form prescribed by department rules and shall be made by the last day of February of the tax year immediately following the year in which the change in the use of the land occurs.  
H. Any person who is required to make a report under the provisions of Subsection G of this section and who fails to do so is personally liable for a civil penalty in an amount equal to the greater of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) or twenty-five percent of the difference between the property taxes ultimately determined to be due and the property taxes originally paid for the tax years for which the person failed to make the required report.

Distinction between subdivided agricultural lands not unconstitutional. — Distinction drawn by 72-2-14.1, 1953 Comp., between subdivided and unsubdivided agricultural land, for tax purposes, did not offend N.M. Const., art. VIII, § 1 and did not violate due process. Property Appraisal Dep't v. Ransom, 1973-NMCA-015, 84 N.M. 637, 506 P.2d 794 (decided under prior law).  
This section establishes special method of valuation for land used primarily for agricultural purposes, determined on the basis of the land's capacity to produce agricultural products. This "Green Belt" law is clearly an exception to the general mode of property valuation for tax purposes established by the Property Tax Code and the New Mexico constitution, i.e., market value. County of Bernalillo v. Ambell, 1980-NMSC-062, 94 N.M. 395, 611 P.2d 218.  
Agricultural land is to be valued based on its capacity to produce, not on its actual production. Jicarilla Apache Nation v. Rio Arriba Cnty. Assessor, 2004-NMCA-055, 135 N.M. 630, 92 P.3d 642, rev’d 2004-NMSC-035, 136 N.M. 630, 103 P.3d 554.

Legislative intent. — A broad reading of "agricultural use" so as to entitle owners of residential, yet pastoral, lands generally to tax relief is inconsistent with the plain language of this section; the section evinces a legislative intent to deny tax relief to those who demonstrate mere passive or incidental cultivation of their lands. Alexander v. Anderson, 1999-NMCA-021, 126 N.M. 632, 973 P.2d 884.  
Crops produced for sale or home consumption. — While growing alfalfa, fruits, nuts, and vegetables may constitute producing crops, an applicant for exemption is required to demonstrate an objective intent to produce a crop for sale or home consumption. Alexander v. Anderson, 1999-NMCA-021, 126 N.M. 632, 973 P.2d 884.  
"Home consumption" construed. — Grazing of recreational horses on taxpayers' property did not satisfy the regulatory provision (3 NMAC 6.5.27.1.1) for "home consumption." Alexander v. Anderson, 1999-NMCA-021, 126 N.M. 632, 973 P.2d 884.  
Regulation upheld. — Promulgation of a regulation (3 NMAC 6.5.27.1.1) to implement the "agricultural use" exemption of this section is a legal exercise of delegated legislative authority and the regulation is consistent with this section's manifest intent. Alexander v. Anderson, 1999-NMCA-021, 126 N.M. 632, 973 P.2d 884.  
Comparable sales wrong criteria under this section. — County assessors using comparable sales instead of agricultural purposes were using the wrong criteria for determining tax on grazing land under this section. In re Armijo, 1976-NMCA-032, 89 N.M. 131, 548 P.2d 93.  
Special valuation not applicable once land changed to nonagricultural use. — Once a property's use has changed from agricultural to nonagricultural, there is no longer the need to give the property owner special tax treatment; the legislature did not desire to give special treatment to former owners of agricultural land even after they voluntarily submit to reclassification of their land for property tax purposes. County of Bernalillo v. Ambell, 1980-NMSC-062, 94 N.M. 395, 611 P.2d 218.  
Hypothetical or speculative values not basis. — Classification or assessment of property for tax purposes premised upon hypothetical or speculative values believed, ultimately or at some later time, to be or become the true market value of such land cannot legitimately be the basis of determining its value. Gerner v. State Tax Comm'n, 1963-NMSC-022, 71 N.M. 385, 378 P.2d 619.  
Grazing land being held for lots. — Classification and valuation of property suitable for grazing purposes at 10 times the valuation of other property of the same character and quality and similarly situated because of its classification as lots held for speculation for oil or other purposes, absent any evidence of such speculative purposes, was so excessive and discriminatory as to entitle taxpayer to relief, despite fact that some other owners of like tracts were similarly assessed or that these lands, while similar to grazing lands, were not actually used for grazing purposes.

7-36-21. Special method of valuation; livestock. 
A. All livestock located in the state on January 1 of the tax year shall be valued for property taxation purposes as of January 1.  
B. All livestock not located in the state on January 1 but brought into the state and located there for more than twenty days subsequent to January 1 shall be valued for property taxation purposes as of the first day of the month following the month in which they have remained in the state for more than twenty days.  
C. The owner of livestock subject to valuation for property taxation purposes shall report the livestock for valuation to the county assessor of the county in which they are located on the valuation date specified in Subsections A or B of this section. However, if an importation or movement report is made by the livestock board under the provisions of Section 7-38-45 NMSA 1978, the owner of livestock is relieved of his responsibility to report the livestock covered by the livestock board report, and that report fulfills the owner's responsibility for reporting the livestock under this section. The owner's report shall be in a form and contain the information required by department regulations and shall be made no later than:  
(1) the last day of February for livestock required to be valued as of the first day of January or February of the tax year; or  
(2) ten days after the valuation date determined under Subsection B of this section for livestock required to be valued as of dates other than those in Paragraph (1) of this subsection.  
D. The department shall establish for each tax year the various classes of livestock and the value of each class. This determination shall be implemented by an order of the director, and the order shall be made no later than December 1 of the year prior to the tax year to which the classification and values apply.  
E. The department shall adopt regulations for the allocation of value of livestock, which regulations shall provide for:  
(1) a basic allocation formula that prorates value on the basis of the amount of time that livestock are in the state and subject to valuation for property taxation purposes;  
(2) determining proration of value under Paragraph (1) of this subsection using estimates of the amount of time that livestock will be in the state to cover those situations in which livestock are imported for an indeterminate time during a tax year or in which resident livestock are exported for an indeterminate time during a tax year but are returned during the same tax year; and  
(3) a method of allocating value of livestock, both resident and transient, among different governmental units when the livestock range on land in more than one governmental unit.  
F. Any person who intentionally refuses to make a report required of him under this section or who knowingly makes a false statement in a report required under this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by the imposition of a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000).  
G. Any person who fails to make a report required of him under this section is liable for a civil penalty in an amount equal to five percent of the property taxes ultimately determined to be due on the property for the tax year or years for which he failed to make the required report.  
H. Any person who intentionally refuses to make a report required of him under this section with the intent to evade any tax or who fails to make a report required of him under this section with the intent to evade any tax is liable for a civil penalty in an amount equal to twenty-five percent of the property taxes ultimately determined to be due on the property for the tax year or years for which he refused or failed to make the required report.  
I. The civil penalties authorized under Subsections G and H of this section shall be imposed and collected at the time and in the manner that the tax is imposed and collected. In order to assist in the imposition and collection of the penalties, the person having responsibility for determining the value of the property shall make an entry in the valuation records indicating the liability for any penalties due under this section.

Repeals. — Laws 1985 (1st S.S.), ch. 12, § 2 repealed 7-36-21.1, as enacted by Laws 1981, ch. 37, § 64, relating to the special method of valuation for residential property, effective January 1, 1986. For present provisions on limitations on property tax rates on residential property, see 7-37-7.1 NMSA 1978.

A. Residential property shall be valued at its current and correct value in accordance with the provisions of the Property Tax Code; provided that for the 2001 and subsequent tax years, the value of a property in any tax year shall not exceed the higher of one hundred three percent of the value in the tax year prior to the tax year in which the property is being valued or one hundred six and one-tenth percent of the value in the tax year two years prior to the tax year in which the property is being valued. This limitation on increases in value does not apply to:  
(1) a residential property in the first tax year that it is valued for property taxation purposes;  
(2) any physical improvements, except for solar energy system installations, made to the property during the year immediately prior to the tax year or omitted in a prior tax year; or  
(3) valuation of a residential property in any tax year in which:  
(a) a change of ownership of the property occurred in the year immediately prior to the tax year for which the value of the property for property taxation purposes is being determined; or  
(b) the use or zoning of the property has changed in the year prior to the tax year.  
B. If a change of ownership of residential property occurred in the year immediately prior to the tax year for which the value of the property for property taxation purposes is being determined, the value of the property shall be its current and correct value as determined pursuant to the general valuation provisions of the Property Tax Code.  
C. To assure that the values of residential property for property taxation purposes are at current and correct values in all counties prior to application of the limitation in Subsection A of this section, the department shall determine for the 2000 tax year the sales ratio pursuant to Section 7-36-18 NMSA 1978 or, if a sales ratio cannot be determined pursuant to that section, conduct a sales-ratio analysis using both independent appraisals by the department and sales. If the sales ratio for a county for the 2000 tax year is less than eighty-five, as measured by the median ratio of value for property taxation purposes to sales price or independent appraisal by the department, the county shall not be subject to the limitations of Subsection A of this section and shall conduct a reassessment of residential property in the county so that by the 2003 tax year, the sales ratio is at least eighty-five. After such reassessment, the limitation on increases in valuation in this section shall apply in those counties in the earlier of the 2004 tax year or the first tax year following the tax year that the county has a sales ratio of eighty-five or higher, as measured by the median ratio of value for property taxation 
purposes to sales value or independent appraisal by the department. Thereafter, the limitation on increases in valuation of residential property for property taxation purposes in this section shall apply to subsequent tax years in all counties.  
D. The provisions of this section do not apply to residential property for any tax year in which the property is subject to the valuation limitation in Section 7-36-21.3 NMSA 1978.  
E. As used in this section, "change of ownership" means a transfer to a transferee by a transferor of all or any part of the transferor's legal or equitable ownership interest in residential property except for a transfer:  
(1) to a trustee for the beneficial use of the spouse of the transferor or the surviving spouse of a deceased transferor;  
(2) to the spouse of the transferor that takes effect upon the death of the transferor;  
(3) that creates, transfers or terminates, solely between spouses, any co-owner's interest;  
(4) to a child of the transferor, who occupies the property as that person's principal residence at the time of transfer; provided that the first subsequent tax year in which that person does not qualify for the head of household exemption on that property, a change of ownership shall be deemed to have occurred;  
(5) that confirms or corrects a previous transfer made by a document that was recorded in the real estate records of the county in which the real property is located;  
(6) for the purpose of quieting the title to real property or resolving a disputed location of a real property boundary;  
(7) to a revocable trust by the transferor with the transferor, the transferor's spouse or a child of the transferor as beneficiary; or  
(8) from a revocable trust described in Paragraph (7) of this subsection back to the settlor or trustor or to the beneficiaries of the trust.  
F. As used in this section, "solar energy system installation" means an installation that is used to provide space heat, hot water or electricity to the property in which it is installed and is:  
(1) an installation that uses solar panels that are not also windows;  
(2) a dark-colored water tank exposed to sunlight; or  
(3) a non-vented trombe wall.

The 2001 amendment, effective April 5, 2001, inserted "or omitted in a prior tax year" in Paragraph A(2); In Subsection C, substituted the language beginning "the department shall determine for the 2000 tax year" to the end of the subsection for that former language that provided for the method of determination if a county was not subject to the limitation in Subsection A; added Subsection D; and redesignated Subsection D as E.  
Constitutional valuation limitations. — Article VIII, Section 1 of the New Mexico Constitution limits the legislature’s existing plenary authority to impose valuation limitations based on taxpayer characteristics to the three enumerated characteristics of age, income, and owner-occupancy. It does not impose any restrictions on the legislature’s authority to impose limitations in valuation increases based on its classification of residential property. Zhao v. Montoya, 2014-NMSC-025, aff'g in part, rev'g in part 2012-NMCA-056, 280 P.3d 918.  
Statute does not violate the New Mexico Constitution. — Section 7-36-21.2 NMSA 1978 does not violate the New Mexico Constitution because it creates an authorized class based on the nature of the property and not on the taxpayer and it does not violate the equal and uniform clause of Article VIII, Section 1 of the New Mexico Constitution because it furthers the legitimate state interest of fostering neighborhood preservation and stability by permitting older owners to pay progressively less taxes than new owners. Zhao v. Montoya, 2014-NMSC-025, aff'g in part, rev'g in part 2012-NMCA-056, 280 P.3d 918.  
Where a property owner purchased a residential property in 2007 that had been assessed and valued at $243,786; in 2008 the property was valued at $362,600; another property owner purchased a new home "around the corner" from the owner’s old home; in 2009, the old home was valued at $553,700 and the new home was valued 
at $902,500; and the owners claimed that they were entitled to the three percent limitation on increase in valuation that applied to other properties in the area that had not changed ownership, that 7-36-21.2 NMSA 1978 was unconstitutional because it created an unauthorized class of residential property taxpayers based solely upon the time of acquisition, not on the constitutionally permissible classifications of owner-occupancy, age or income, and violated the equal and uniform clause of Article VIII, Section 1 of the New Mexico Constitution, 7-36-21.2 NMSA 1978 was not unconstitutional because it created an authorized class based on the nature of property and not the taxpayer and because it furthered the legitimate state interest of fostering neighborhood preservation and stability by permitting older owners to pay progressively less taxes than new owners. Zhao v. Montoya, 2014-NMSC-025, aff'g in part, rev'g in part 2012-NMCA-056, 280 P.3d 918.  
Valuation methods did not create a new class of taxpayers. — The different valuation methods under 7-36-21.2 NMSA 1978 for newly sold residential property and residential property owned more than a year do not create a new class of taxpayer in violation of Paragraph B of Article VIII, Section 1 of the constitution of New Mexico because 7-36-21.2 NMSA 1978 limits revaluation for taxation purposes based on owner-occupant status. Zhao v. Montoya, 2012-NMCA-056, 280 P.3d 918, aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 2014-NMSC-025.  
Where homeowners bought and occupied new homes and in the year following their purchase, the county valued their property at significantly greater amounts for tax purposes than the county had valued the property for the previous owners; as a result of the revaluation, the property tax assessment for the property significantly increased; and the homeowners claimed that 7-36-21.2 NMSA 1978 was unconstitutional because it created a new class of taxpayer based on the time of acquisition of property, 7-36-21.2 NMSA 1978 did not create a new class of taxpayer because the homeowners did not obtain the benefit of the limitation of increases in assessed value until they purchased the property, at which time, the homeowners became members of the class of owner-occupants to whom the limitation applies. Zhao v. Montoya, 2012-NMCA-056, 280 P.3d 918, aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 2014-NMSC-025. 
Change of ownership. — Where respondents made property transfers between individuals or their trusts and wholly-owned limited liability companies (LLC), the Bernalillo county valuation protest board erred in determining that the transfers did not constitute a change of ownership on the grounds that the property had the same ultimate owner owning the property, because this section expressly carves out eight exceptions to the definition of "change of ownership," none of which includes transfers between individuals or their trusts and LLCs formed to hold title to their properties.  A transfer of residential property between an LLC's members and the LLC itself constitutes a change of ownership, subjecting the property to a valuation based upon its current and correct value, regardless of whether the proportional beneficial interests remain intact.  Giddings v. SRT-Mountain Vista, LLC, 2019-NMCA-025.  
7-36-21.3. Limitation on increase in value for single-family dwellings occupied by low-income owners who are sixty-five years of age or older or disabled; requirements; penalties. 
A. The valuation for property taxation purposes of a single-family dwelling owned and occupied by a person who is sixty-five years of age or older or disabled and whose modified gross income for the prior taxable year did not exceed the greater of thirty-five thousand dollars ($35,000) or the amount calculated pursuant to Subsection F of this section shall not be greater than the assessed valuation of the property for property taxation purposes: 
(1) for a person sixty-five years of age or older in the tax year in which the owner qualifies and files an application; or 
(2) for a person who is disabled in the tax year in which the owner qualified and files an application for the limitation provided by this section. 
B. The limitation provided by this section may be claimed by filing proof of eligibility with the county assessor on an application form furnished by the assessor.  The application shall be filed no later than thirty days after the date of mailing by the assessor of the notice of valuation.  The application form shall be designed by the department and shall provide for proof of age or disability, occupancy and income eligibility.  An owner who applies for the limitation of value specified in this section and files proof of income eligibility for the three consecutive years immediately subsequent to the tax year for which the application is made need not claim the limitation for subsequent tax years if there is no change in eligibility.  The county assessor shall apply the limitation automatically in subsequent tax years until a change in eligibility occurs. 
C. An owner who has claimed and been allowed the limitation of value specified in this section for the three consecutive tax years immediately prior to the 2020 tax year is not required to claim the limitation for subsequent tax years if there is no change in eligibility, unless the county assessor requests updated information on the owner's modified gross income.  The county assessor shall apply the limitation automatically in subsequent tax years until a change in eligibility occurs. 
D. A person who has had a limitation applied to a tax year and subsequently becomes ineligible for the limitation because of a change in the person's status or income or a change in the ownership of the property against which the limitation was applied shall notify the county assessor of the loss of eligibility for the limitation by the last day of February of the tax year immediately following the year in which loss of eligibility occurs. 
E. A person who knowingly violates the provisions of this section by intentionally claiming and receiving the benefit of a limitation to which the person is not entitled or who fails to comply with the provisions of Subsection D of this section shall be liable for all taxes due, interest and a civil penalty of one thousand dollars ($1,000). 
F. For the 2020 tax year and each subsequent tax year, the maximum amount of modified gross income in Subsection A of this section shall be adjusted to account for inflation.  The department shall make the adjustment by multiplying thirty-five thousand dollars ($35,000) by a fraction, the numerator of which is the consumer price index ending during the prior tax year and the denominator of which is the consumer price index ending in tax year 2019.  The result of the multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest one hundred dollars ($100), except that if the result would be an amount less than the corresponding amount for the preceding tax year, then no adjustment shall be made.  
G. The department shall publish annually the amount determined by the calculation made pursuant to Subsection F of this section and provide the calculated amount to each county assessor no later than December 1 of each tax year. 
H. The limitation of value specified in Subsection A of this section does not apply to: 
(1) a change in valuation resulting from any physical improvements made to the property during the year immediately prior to the tax year or a change in the permitted use or zoning of the property during the year immediately prior to the tax year; or 
(2) a residential property in the first tax year that is valued for property taxation purposes. 
I. As used in this section: 
(1) "consumer price index" means the consumer price index for all urban consumers published by the United States department of labor for the month ending September 30; 
(2) "disabled" means a person who has been determined to be blind or permanently disabled with medical improvement not expected pursuant to 42 USCA 421 for purposes of the federal Social Security Act or is determined to have a permanent total disability pursuant to the Workers' Compensation Act [Chapter 52, Article 1 NMSA 1978]; and 
(3) "modified gross income" means "modified gross income" as used in the Income Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 2 NMSA 1978].

7-36-22. Mineral property; definitions and classifications for valuation purposes. 
As used in this article, "mineral property" does not include oil and gas property or productive copper mineral property and means:  
A. "class one productive mineral property", which means mineral lands, all mineral reserves and interests in minerals in mineral lands and all severed mineral products from mineral lands when the mineral lands are held under private ownership in fee and the property is mined or operated in good faith for its mineral values with a reasonable degree of continuity during the year preceding the tax year in which its value is determined and to an extent in keeping with the market demand and conditions affecting the extraction and disposition of the product;  
B. "class one nonproductive mineral property", which means mineral lands, all mineral reserves and interests in minerals in mineral lands and all severed mineral products from mineral lands when the mineral lands are held under private ownership in fee and the property is known to contain minerals in commercially workable quantities of such a character as add present value to the land in addition to its values for other purposes but is not operated so as to fall in the class of class one productive mineral property;  
C. "class two mineral property", which means the severed mineral products from mineral lands held by possessory title under the laws of the United States; and  
D. "class three mineral property", which means severed mineral products from leasehold or contract mineral rights in mineral lands, the fee of which is vested in the United States or the state.  
History: 1953 Comp., § 72-29-11, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 258, § 23; 1975, ch. 218, § 2; 1990, ch. 125, § 4.

Cross references. — For mines and mining, see Chapter 69 NMSA 1978.  
The 1990 amendment, effective March 7, 1990, inserted "for productive copper mineral property" in the introductory language.  
Nonseverability. — Laws 1990, ch. 125, § 19 provided that the provisions of the Copper Production Ad Valorem Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 39 NMSA 1978] and the corresponding amendments made in that act to the Property Tax Code [Articles 35 to 38 of Chapter 7 NMSA 1978] are not severable.  
Neither supreme court nor district court may reclassify, revalue or reassess property improperly classified by taxing officials and, consequently, assess at an excessive valuation. Gerner v. State Tax Comm'n, 1963-NMSC-022, 71 N.M. 385, 378 P.2d 619.  
Negative mineral property production figure disallowed. — The statutory requirement of allocating the net taxable value of each item of property used in connection with mineral property prevents the use of the negative value for mineral property production to reduce the valuation of property valued under Section 7-36-33 NMSA 1978; therefore, the taxpayer cannot use a negative figure for mineral property production to reduce the positive value of property used in connection with mineral property. U.V. Indus., Inc. v. Property Tax Div. of Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1979-NMCA-147, 93 N.M. 651, 603 P.2d 1108.  
Valuation to be fixed by standards. — To have uniformity and equality in a form of tax, the valuations must be established by some standard; and after valuations are fixed, the taxes based upon such valuations must be levied by a standard. It is only thus that each taxpayer may bear his fair share of the burden of government. Gerner v. State Tax Comm'n, 1963-NMSC-022, 71 N.M. 385, 378 P.2d 619.  
Regulation based upon taxpayer's federal tax treatment of property. — Regulation providing that, if a taxpayer attributed development expenditures to a particular piece of property under 26 USCS § 616, the property was rebuttably presumed, for the next 10 years, to contain minerals in such quantities and character so as to classify the property as class one nonproductive mineral property under Subsection B, was a valid regulation in that it was not arbitrary because the taxpayer would have opportunity to present facts to rebut the presumption; in that there was substantial evidence to support the regulation; and in that the regulation was not substantive, since it announced a procedure for classifying the property based upon the taxpayer's treatment of the property for federal tax purposes. Santa Fe Pac.R.R. v. Property Tax Dep't, 1976-NMCA-071, 89 N.M. 446, 553 P.2d 726 (Ct. App. 1976).

7-36-23. Special method of valuation; mineral property and property used in connection with mineral property; exception for potash and uranium mineral property and property used in connection with potash and uranium mineral property. 
A. The provisions of this section apply to the valuation of all mineral property and property used in connection with mineral property except potash and uranium mineral property and property used in connection with potash and uranium mineral property, the methods of valuation for which are provided in Sections 7-36-24 and 7-36-25 NMSA 1978.  
B. The following kinds of property held or used in connection with mineral property shall be valued under the methods of valuation required by the Property Tax Code:  
(1) improvements, equipment, materials, supplies and other personal property held or used in connection with all classes of mineral property; "improvements" as used in this section includes surface and subsurface structures, but does not include pits, shafts, drifts and other similar artificial changes in the physical condition of the surface or subsurface of the earth produced solely by the removal or rearrangement of earth or minerals for the purpose of exposing or removing ore from a mine; and  
(2) the surface value for agricultural or other purposes of class one productive or nonproductive mineral property when the surface interest is held in the same ownership as the mineral interests.  
C. The value for property taxation purposes of class one productive mineral property is an amount equal to three hundred percent of the annual net production value of the mineral property.  
D. The value for property taxation purposes of class two and class three mineral property is an amount equal to three hundred percent of the annual net production value.  
E. The value for property taxation purposes of class one nonproductive mineral property shall be determined by applying a per acre value to the surface acres of the property being valued. The per acre value of class one nonproductive mineral property shall be determined under regulations adopted by the department, which regulations shall establish a per acre value based upon bonus bids accepted by the commissioner of public lands for the latest one year period in which bonus bids were accepted for the sale of mineral leases, which per acre value may be determined by geographical areas.  
F. For purposes of this section, "annual net production value" means either:  
(1) the average of five years' net production value from the mineral property for the five years immediately preceding the tax year in which value is being determined, or so much of the period during which the property has been in operation, with each year's net production value being determined by taking the year's market value of production of all minerals, including any bonus or subsidy payments, and deducting from that value:  
(a) any royalties paid or due the United States, the state or any Indian tribe, Indian pueblo or Indian who is a ward of the United States;  
(b) the direct costs, exclusive of depreciation, determined under generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied by the taxpayer, of extracting, milling, treating, reducing, transporting and selling the minerals; and  
(c) the costs of depreciation, determined under generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied by the taxpayer, of property actually used in the extracting, milling, treating, reducing and transporting of the minerals; or  
(2) the net production value from the mineral property for the year immediately preceding the tax year in which value is being determined, with that year's net production value being determined by taking the year's market value of production of all minerals, including any bonus or subsidy payments, and deducting from that value:  
(a) any royalties paid or due the United States, the state or any Indian tribe, Indian pueblo or Indian who is a ward of the United States;  
(b) the direct costs, exclusive of depreciation, determined under generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied by the taxpayer, of extracting, milling, treating, reducing, transporting and selling the minerals; and  
(c) the cost of depreciation, determined under generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied by the taxpayer, of property actually used in the extracting, milling, treating, reducing and transporting of the minerals.  
G. Annual net production value shall be determined under Paragraph (1) of Subsection F of this section unless the taxpayer elects to have it determined under Paragraph (2) of that subsection. To be effective, an election must be exercised by written notification to the department at the time the mineral property is reported to the department for valuation in a tax year. Once an election is exercised, a taxpayer may not change from the elected method without the prior approval of the department.  
H. The department shall adopt regulations specifying procedures to be followed under, and the details of, the method for valuation of mineral property specified in this section.

Fair market value is theoretically what a willing seller would take and a willing buyer offer. Kaiser Steel Corp. v. Property Appraisal Dep't, 1976-NMCA-071, 83 N.M. 251, 490 P.2d 968, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 258, 490 P.2d 975.  
Payments to be included in market value. — Portions of former 72-6-7(6), 1953 Comp., are pertinent as the market value is to include bonus or subsidy payments and there is evidence that the royalty payments fall into that category; however, amounts paid for improvements are not to be included as part of the costs, and depreciation on such improvements should also not be included. Kaiser Steel Corp. v. Property Appraisal Dep't, 1976-NMCA-071, 83 N.M. 251, 490 P.2d 968, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 258, 490 P.2d 975.  
Market price as exchange value. — As to the price between a fictional seller and buyer, the market price of a commodity is the exchange value and it is determined by the demand for it in relation to the supply and is proved, when possible, by actual sales. Kaiser Steel Corp. v. Property Appraisal Dep't, 1976-NMCA-071, 83 N.M. 251, 490 P.2d 968, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 258, 490 P.2d 975.  
Essential factors in determining market value are the existence of a demand and the accessibility of a market. Without a demand a rich natural resource may lie dormant and be commercially valueless. Create an active demand and the same deposit may find a ready market. Similarly, proximity to market may be a determining factor. Kaiser Steel Corp. v. Property Appraisal Dep't, 1976-NMCA-071, 83 N.M. 251, 490 P.2d 968, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 258, 490 P.2d 975.  
Determination of market value of average annual output, less the actual cost, over the period of years involved requires an averaging of the costs. Kaiser Steel Corp. v. Property Appraisal Dep't, 1976-NMCA-071, 83 N.M. 251, 490 P.2d 968, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 258, 490 P.2d 975.

Separate taxation of severed mineral estates required. — Former New Mexico statutory provisions required the separate taxation of severed mineral estates and the public policy of this state was to tax separately the severed mineral rights from the remainder of the fee when in different ownerships. Kaye v. Cooper Grocery Co., 1957-NMSC-049, 63 N.M. 36, 312 P.2d 798.  
Even after conveyance of fractional undivided interest in the minerals, the entire mineral estate should be separately assessed and taxed as a unit. Kaye v. Cooper Grocery Co., 1957-NMSC-049, 63 N.M. 36, 312 P.2d 798.  
Partial severance considered complete severance. — For assessment purposes, a partial severance conveyance is to be considered a complete severance of the mineral estate. Kaye v. Cooper Grocery Co., 1957-NMSC-049, 63 N.M. 36, 312 P.2d 798.  
Duty of tenant in common to pay entire assessment. — The surface owner who has retained an undivided mineral interest becomes a tenant in common as to the mineral estate with his transferee of an undivided mineral interest, and as tenants in common each had the duty to pay the entire assessment on the mineral estate with a right of contribution against his cotenant for a proportionate part. Kaye v. Cooper Grocery Co., 1957-NMSC-049, 63 N.M. 36, 312 P.2d 798.  
Owner of mineral estate will not lose interest through tax sale. — When the entire mineral estate has been conveyed by the surface owner and the mineral deed has been recorded prior to the assessment for the tax year, the owner of the mineral estate will not lose his interest through a tax sale unless the mineral estate has been separately assessed and the sale is had for the purpose of recovering delinquent taxes assessed against the mineral estate. Kaye v. Cooper Grocery Co., 1957-NMSC-049, 63 N.M. 36, 312 P.2d 798.  
Negative mineral property production figure disallowed. — The statutory requirement of allocating the net taxable value of each item of property used in connection with mineral property prevents the use of the negative value for mineral property production to reduce the valuation of property valued under Section 7-36-33 NMSA 1978; therefore, the taxpayer cannot use a negative figure for mineral property production to reduce the positive value of property used in connection with mineral property. U.V. Indus., Inc. v. Prop. Tax Div. of Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1979-NMCA-147, 93 N.M. 651, 603 P.2d 1108.  
Regulation modifying statutory determination of annual net production contrary to section. — Regulation providing that the property tax department would not permit the use of minus figures for a particular year's net production value in calculating the average of five years' net production value was contrary to the provisions of Subsection F because the property tax department had no authority to adopt regulations modifying the statutory provision for determining the annual net production value. Santa Fe Pac.R.R. v. Prop. Tax Dep't, 1976-NMCA-071, 89 N.M. 446, 553 P.2d 726.  
Regulation for geographical variance multiplier set aside. — Regulation providing for the use of a multiplier of 100 and of a quotient derived by dividing the total of the bonus bids by the number of acres leased by competitive bidding within a county was set aside since the provision in Subsection E for geographical variance did not support use of such multiplier because the evidence was that procedures for implementing such 
a variance had not been developed by property tax department. Santa Fe Pac.R.R. v. Prop. Tax Dep't, 1976-NMCA-071, 89 N.M. 446, 553 P.2d 726.  
Burden of proof was on contestant and was both the burden of producing evidence and the burden of persuasion which was, in this case, where the validity of the state's valuation is in issue, not the burden of showing the correct valuation but to show the state's valuation was erroneous. However, an asserted failure in contestant's burden of persuasion does not require that the court uphold the state's valuation when that valuation is not supported by substantial evidence. Kaiser Steel Corp. v. Property Appraisal Dep't, 1971-NMCA-131, 83 N.M. 251, 490 P.2d 968, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 258, 490 P.2d 975.  
Finding not supported by evidence inference. — Since the market value of the mine run coal was based on evidence of sales of 4% and 9% of production at $8.50 per ton, this evidence did not support an inference that 96% and 91% of production had a market value of $8.50 per ton absent evidence of a market at that price and, therefore, the finding utilizing a market value of $8.50 per ton for all mine run coal was not supported by substantial evidence. Kaiser Steel Corp. v. Property Appraisal Dep't, 1971-NMCA-131, 83 N.M. 251, 490 P.2d 968, cert. denied, 83 N.M. 258, 490 P.2d 975.

A. The provisions of this section apply to valuation of all mineral property and property used in connection with mineral property when the primary production from the mineral property is potash.  
B. The value for property taxation purposes of improvements, equipment, materials, supplies and other personal property held or used in connection with all classes of potash mineral property is an amount equal to the market value of all mineral production from the potash mineral property for the prior year, less any royalties paid or due the United States, the state or any Indian tribe, Indian pueblo or Indian who is a ward of the United States. "Improvements" as used in this section includes surface and subsurface structures, but does not include pits, shafts, drifts and other similar artificial changes in the physical condition of the surface or subsurface of the earth produced solely by the removal or rearrangement of earth or minerals for the purpose of exposing or removing ore from a mine.  
C. The value for property taxation purposes of the surface value for agricultural or other purposes held in connection with class one productive or nonproductive potash mineral property, when the surface interest is held in the same ownership as the mineral interests, shall be determined under the methods of valuation required by the Property Tax Code.  
D. The value for property taxation purposes of class one productive potash mineral property is an amount equal to fifty percent of the market value of all mineral production from the potash mineral property for the prior year.  
E. The value for property taxation purposes of class two and class three potash mineral property is an amount equal to fifty percent of the amount derived by deducting from the market value of all mineral production from the potash mineral property for the prior year any royalties paid or due the United States, the state or any Indian tribe, Indian pueblo or Indian who is a ward of the United States.  
F. The value for property taxation purposes of class one nonproductive potash mineral property shall be determined under Subsection E of Section 7-36-23 NMSA 1978.  
G. If a taxpayer severs potash in one or more governmental units and processes the severed potash in another governmental unit, the value of all interests in minerals shall be allocated to the governmental unit or units in which the potash is severed, and the value of improvements, equipment, materials, supplies and personal property shall be allocated among the governmental units in which the property is located on the basis of the original cost of the property.  
H. The department shall adopt regulations specifying procedures to be followed under, and the details of, the method for valuation of potash mineral property specified in this section. The department shall also adopt regulations for the allocation of values of potash mineral property among the governmental units.

7-36-25. Special method of valuation; mineral property and property used in connection with mineral property when the primary production from the mineral property is uranium. 
A. The provisions of this section apply to the valuation of all mineral property and property used in connection with mineral property when the primary production from the mineral property is uranium.  
B. The following kinds of property held or used in connection with uranium mineral property shall be valued under the methods of valuation required by the Property Tax Code:  
(1) improvements, equipment, materials, supplies and other personal property held or used in connection with all classes of uranium mineral property; "improvements" as used in this section includes surface and subsurface structures, but does not include pits, shafts, drifts or other similar artificial changes in the physical condition of the surface or subsurface of the earth produced solely by the removal or rearrangement of earth or minerals for the purpose of exposing or removing ore from a mine; and  
(2) the surface value for agricultural or other purposes of class one productive or nonproductive uranium mineral property when the surface interest is held in the same ownership as the mineral interests.  
C. The value for property taxation purposes of class one productive, class two and class three uranium mineral property is the annual net production value of the uranium mineral property.  
D. The value for property taxation purposes of class one nonproductive uranium mineral property shall be determined under Subsection E of Section 7-36-23 NMSA 1978.  
E. For the purposes of this section, the "annual net production value" means:  
(1) the sales price of uranium-bearing material disposed of as ore or solution, less fifty percent of that sales price as a deduction for the cost of producing and bringing the output to the surface and of transporting and selling it; or  
(2) in the case of uranium-bearing material not disposed of as ore or solution but processed or beneficiated (other than by sizing and blending), regardless of the form in which the product is actually disposed of, the value of U3O8 contained in ore or solution determined on the basis of the U3O8 content of the ore or solution at fifty percent of the taxpayer's average unit sales price during the preceding calendar year of U3O8 contained in the concentrate form commonly known as "yellowcake" (or if the uranium concentrate has not been sold in the preceding calendar year, at fifty percent of the representative sales price for U3O8 contained in the concentrate form commonly known as "yellowcake" at the place and time of processing or beneficiation into that concentrate), plus fifty percent of the representative sales price of all other minerals produced and saved from such uranium-bearing material, less fifty percent of the value as a deduction for the cost of producing and bringing the output to the surface from an underground mine.  
F. In determining annual net production value of class two and class three uranium mineral property, a deduction may be taken for royalties paid or due the United States, the state or any Indian tribe, Indian pueblo or Indian who is a ward of the United States, but the deduction allowed by this subsection must be subtracted from one hundred percent of the applicable sales price before applying any other reductions in or deductions from that sales price.

Section deemed constitutional. — Since the classification, in Subsection E, distinguishing open-pit mines from underground mines is reasonable and the tax imposed by this section is uniform and equal on all subjects of a class, this section is constitutional.

There is reasonable basis for division of mines for tax purposes into the classes of underground and open-pit mines: the basis for the classification is the difference between the cost of producing and bringing uranium ore to the surface in the two types of mines; since this cost is greater in underground than in open-pit mines, it was within the legislature's power to provide a tax deduction to underground mines that it did not grant to open-pit mines.

Interpretation of "communications system". — Where plaintiff cable company repurposed parts of its cable television system and expanded its services to include broadband internet and interconnected voice over internet protocol (VoIP) services, which both transmit and receive information, and where the New Mexico taxation and revenue department began assessing taxes on all cable companies operating in the state which provided two-way communications services, reclassified plaintiff's property as a "communications system", and assessed taxes on plaintiff's property accordingly, the district court erred in granting plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and in concluding that plaintiff's property is not a "communications system" under the Tax Code, because in light of the clear, unambiguous definition of "communications system" in 7-36-30(B)(1) NMSA 1978, the legislature intended to grant the department the authority to classify plaintiff’s property as a "communications system" and assess it under this section when plaintiff elected to repurpose portions of its system in order to provide two-way communications services to its customers.

Department found in contempt for failing to value and assess high-voltage transmission lines for property taxes. — Where petitioners petitioned for a writ of mandamus to compel the New Mexico taxation and revenue department (department) to establish values for two high-voltage transmission lines in Harding county and report those values to the Harding county assessor so that property taxes could be assessed on the lines, and where the district court issued the peremptory writ, determining that the transmission lines were taxable, and ordered the department to complete the valuation processes for the two transmission lines, timely conclude any protests, and certify the values to the county assessor for preparation of a bill for the property tax due, and where, following an administrative hearing officer's conclusion that the transmission lines did not have any value for tax assessment purposes, the department certified that the transmission lines were not taxable, which was contrary to the district court's order, and certified to the district court that the department complied with the court's order, and where petitioners then filed a motion for an order to show cause, arguing that the department had not complied with the peremptory writ, the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding the department in contempt and in awarding petitioners attorney fees as sanctions, because the department admittedly failed to act in accordance with the dictates of the law after the district court ordered the department to act and after the department was given notice and an opportunity to be heard.

7-37-7.1. Additional limitations on property tax rates. 
A. Except as provided in Subsections D and E of this section, in setting the general property tax rates for residential and nonresidential property authorized in Subsection B of Section 7-37-7 NMSA 1978, the other rates and impositions authorized in Paragraphs (2) and (3) of Subsection C of Section 7-37-7 NMSA 1978, except the portion of the rate authorized in Paragraph (1) of Subsection A of Section 4-48B-12 NMSA 1978 used to meet the requirements of Section 27-10-4 NMSA 1978, and benefit assessments authorized by law to be levied upon net taxable value of property, assessed value or a similar term, neither the department of finance and administration nor any other entity authorized to set or impose a rate or assessment shall set a rate or impose a tax or assessment that will produce revenue from either residential or nonresidential property in a particular governmental unit in excess of the sum of a dollar amount derived by multiplying the appropriate growth control factor by the revenue due from the imposition on residential or nonresidential property, as appropriate, for the prior property tax year in the governmental unit of the rate, imposition or assessment for the specified purpose plus, for the calculation for the rate authorized for county operating purposes by Subsection B of Section 7-37-7 NMSA 1978 with respect to residential property, any applicable tax rebate adjustment. The calculation described in this subsection shall be separately made for residential and nonresidential property. Except as provided in Subsections D and E of this section, no tax rate or benefit assessment that will produce revenue from either class of property in a particular governmental unit in excess of the dollar amount allowed by the calculation shall be set or imposed. The rates imposed pursuant to Sections 7-32-4 and 7-34-4 NMSA 1978 shall be the rates for nonresidential property that would have been imposed but for the limitations in this section. As used in this section, "growth control factor" is a percentage equal to the sum of "percent change I" plus V where:  
 
 (1)  
 V  
 =  
 (base year value + net new value),  
  
 
 
  
  
  
 base year value  
  
 


expressed as a percentage, but if the percentage calculated is less than one hundred percent, then V shall be set and used as one hundred percent;  
(2) "base year value" means the value for property taxation purposes of all residential or nonresidential property, as appropriate, subject to valuation under the Property Tax Code in the governmental unit for the specified purpose in the prior property tax year;  
(3) "net new value" means the additional value of residential or nonresidential property, as appropriate, for property taxation purposes placed on the property tax schedule in the current year resulting from the elements in Subparagraphs (a) through 
(d) of this paragraph reduced by the value of residential or nonresidential property, as appropriate, removed from the property tax schedule in the current year and, if applicable, the reductions described in Subparagraph (e) of this paragraph:  
(a) residential or nonresidential property, as appropriate, valued in the current year that was not valued at all in the prior year;  
(b) improvements to existing residential or nonresidential property, as appropriate;  
(c) additions to residential or nonresidential property, as appropriate, or values that were omitted from previous years' property tax schedules even if part or all of the property was included on the schedule, but no additions of values attributable to valuation maintenance programs or reappraisal programs shall be included;  
(d) additions to nonresidential property due to increases in annual net production values of mineral property valued in accordance with Section 7-36-23 or 7-36-25 NMSA 1978 or due to increases in market value of mineral property valued in accordance with Section 7-36-24 NMSA 1978; and  
(e) reductions to nonresidential property due to decreases in annual net production values of mineral property valued in accordance with Section 7-36-23 or 7-36-25 NMSA 1978 or due to decreases in market value of mineral property valued in accordance with Section 7-36-24 NMSA 1978; and  
(4) "percent change I" means a percent not in excess of five percent that is derived by dividing the annual implicit price deflator index for state and local government purchases of goods and services, as published in the United States department of commerce monthly publication entitled "survey of current business" or any successor publication, for the calendar year next preceding the prior calendar year into the difference between the prior year's comparable annual index and that next preceding year's annual index if that difference is an increase, and if the difference is a decrease, the "percent change I" is zero. In the event that the annual implicit price deflator index for state and local government purchases of goods and services is no longer prepared or published by the United States department of commerce, the department shall adopt by regulation the use of any comparable index prepared by any agency of the United States.  
B. If, as a result of the application of the limitation imposed under Subsection A of this section, a property tax rate for residential or nonresidential property, as appropriate, authorized in Subsection B of Section 7-37-7 NMSA 1978 is reduced below the maximum rate authorized in that subsection, no governmental unit or entity authorized to impose a tax rate under Paragraph (2) of Subsection C of Section 7-37-7 NMSA 1978 shall impose any portion of the rate representing the difference between a maximum rate authorized under Subsection B of Section 7-37-7 NMSA 1978 and the reduced rate 
resulting from the application of the limitation imposed under Subsection A of this section.  
C. If the net new values necessary to make the computation required under Subsection A of this section are not available for any governmental unit at the time the calculation must be made, the department of finance and administration shall use a zero amount for net new values when making the computation for the governmental unit.  
D. Any part of the maximum tax rate authorized for each governmental unit for residential and nonresidential property by Subsection B of Section 7-37-7 NMSA 1978 that is not imposed for a governmental unit for any property tax year for reasons other than the limitation required under Subsection A of this section may be authorized by the department of finance and administration to be imposed for that governmental unit for residential and nonresidential property for the following tax year subject to the restriction of Subsection D of Section 7-38-33 NMSA 1978.  
E. If the base year value necessary to make the computation required under Subsection A of this section is not available for any governmental unit at the time the calculation must be made, the department of finance and administration shall set a rate for residential and nonresidential property that will produce in that governmental unit a dollar amount that is not in excess of the property tax revenue due for all property for the prior property tax year for the specified purpose of that rate in that governmental unit.  
F. For the purposes of this section:  
(1) "nonresidential property" does not include any property upon which taxes are imposed pursuant to the Oil and Gas Ad Valorem Production Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 32 NMSA 1978], the Oil and Gas Production Equipment Ad Valorem Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 34 NMSA 1978] or the Copper Production Ad Valorem Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 39 NMSA 1978]; and  
(2) "tax rebate adjustment" means, for those counties that have an ordinance in effect providing the property tax rebate pursuant to the Income Tax Act [Chapter 7, Article 2 NMSA 1978] for the property tax year and that have not imposed for the property tax year either a property tax, the revenue from which is pledged for payment of the income tax revenue reduction resulting from the provision of the property tax rebate, or a property transfer tax, the estimated amount of the property tax rebate to be allowed with respect to the property tax year, and for any other governmental unit or purpose, zero; provided that any estimate of property tax rebate to be allowed is subject to review for appropriateness and approval by the department of finance and administration.

Assessor's valuation sufficient evidence to support decision. — Since the assessor's valuation is presumed to be correct, it is sufficient evidence, where uncontradicted, to support the board's decision. Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.  
Application of presumption. — The question whether property is entitled to the special valuation method in Section 7-36-20 NMSA 1978 is a question of classification; property that is classified as agricultural is entitled to the benefit of that section, whereas other property is not. Jicarilla Apache Nation v. Rodarte, 2004-NMSC-035, 136 N.M. 630, 103 P.3d 554, rev'g 2004-NMCA-055, 135 N.M. 630, 92 P.3d 642.  
Presumption in this section is applicable only to the value of property and inapplicable when the question is whether a taxpayer is entitled to the special method of valuation provided for in 7-36-20 NMSA 1978. Jicarilla Apache Nation v. Rio Arriba Cnty. Assessor, 2004-NMCA-055, 135 N.M. 630, 92 P.3d 642, rev'd 2004-NMSC-035, 136 N.M. 630, 103 P.3d 554.  
Presumption is rebuttable and is best characterized as a prima facie inference in that it shifts the burden of going forward with the evidence to the taxpayer to prove the contrary. Petition of Kinscherff, 1976-NMCA-097, 89 N.M. 669, 556 P.2d 355, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 8, 558 P.2d 620; N.M. Baptist Found. v. Bernalillo Cnty. Assessor, 1979-NMCA-102, 93 N.M. 363, 600 P.2d 309.  
Presumption of correctness can be overcome by taxpayer's showing that an assessor did not follow the statutory provisions of the act or by presenting evidence tending to dispute the factual correctness of the valuation. N.M. Baptist Found. v. Bernalillo Cnty. Assessor, 1979-NMCA-102, 93 N.M. 363, 600 P.2d 309; La Jara Land Developers, Inc. v. Bernalillo County Assessor, 1982-NMCA-006, 97 N.M. 318, 639 P.2d 605.  
Overcoming the statutory presumption of correctness afforded to the assessor’s valuation. — Where appellant sought review of the Bernalillo county valuation protests board’s (protests board) valuation of appellant’s commercial property, where appellant offered evidence of value tending to dispute the factual correctness of the county assessor’s method of valuation, where the county assessor did not offer expert testimony disputing that appellant’s method of valuation was a generally accepted appraisal technique, and where neither the protests board nor the district court ruled that appellant failed to overcome the statutory presumption of correctness afforded to 
the assessor’s valuation, the appellant overcame the statutory presumption of correctness and the burden shifted to the assessor to prove that his or her method of valuation utilized a generally accepted appraisal technique. 2727 San Pedro LLC v. Bernalillo Cty. Assessor, 2017-NMCA-008.  
Since taxpayer overcame presumption, burden rested on assessor. — This presumption is rebuttable and is best characterized as a prima facie inference in that it shifts the burden of going forward with the evidence to the taxpayer to prove the contrary; where taxpayer's protest and evidence overcame the presumption the burden rested on the county assessor to meet the contentions of the taxpayer. San Pedro S. Group v. Bernalillo Cnty. Valuation Protest Bd., 1976-NMCA-116, 89 N.M. 784, 558 P.2d 53.  
Since taxpayer overcame presumption, burden rested on assessor. — While the county assessor's valuation is presumed to be correct, this presumption is rebuttable, and, once rebutted, the burden shifts to the county assessor to show the correct valuation. Bakel v. Bernalillo Cnty. Assessor, 1980-NMCA-173, 95 N.M. 723, 625 P.2d 1240; Protest of Plaza Del Sol Ltd. P'ship v. Assessor for Cnty. of Bernalillo, 1986-NMCA-022, 104 N.M. 154, 717 P.2d 1123.  
This section places the burden on the taxpayer to overcome the presumption of correctness, but, the burden shifted to the county assessor to show a correct valuation once that burden of correctness is overcome. Cibola Energy Corp. v. Roselli, 1987-NMCA-055, 105 N.M. 774, 737 P.2d 555.  
Since taxpayer's valuation is supported by the whole record in that after rebutting the assessor's valuation and presenting a prima facie case for its own valuation the board failed to rebut taxpayer's appraisal, the decision of the board will be reversed and remanded with instructions that the board enter judgment for taxpayer in favor of its valuations. Cibola Energy Corp. v. Roselli, 1987-NMCA-055, 105 N.M. 774, 737 P.2d 555.  
Taxpayer effectively rebutted presumption. — Since taxpayers presented uncontradicted evidence that access to their property was physically blocked and also offered the only substantial evidence of the fair market value of the property in the form of testimony by a real estate appraiser that because of the lack of access the highest and best use that the property could be put to was as grazing land by one of the adjoining landowners, and that as such it had a fair market value of $18.00 per acre, or $2034 and $5022 respectively for the two tracts, they effectively rebutted the presumption of this section that the county assessor's valuations of $313,875 and $169,500 were correct. Petition of Kinscherff, 1976-NMCA-097, 89 N.M. 669, 556 P.2d 355, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 8, 558 P.2d 620.  
When presumption unrebutted by lack of comparable sales evidence. — Since the documents relied upon by a taxpayer as evidence of comparable sales are documents dealing with the sale of that very improvement whose valuation is the subject of the 
present dispute and the only evidence submitted by the taxpayer failed to present any evidence of sales of comparable property and the evidence submitted does not establish a market value under Section 7-36-15B NMSA 1978 and the statutory presumption of correctness still stands. N.M. Baptist Found. v. Bernalillo Cnty. Assessor, 1979-NMCA-102, 93 N.M. 363, 600 P.2d 309.  
Presumption of assessor's valuation not overcome. — Since taxpayer failed to present any evidence of sales of comparable property or evidence of value based on generally accepted appraisal techniques, and its only evidence, the purchase price of its land in question, did not establish a market value under Section 7-36-15 NMSA 1978, the presumption of the correctness of the assessor's valuation was not overcome. Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.  
Failure to overcome presumption. — Taxpayers' offer of the price for which they had purchased the property in question as evidence of fair market value failed to overcome the presumption of the correctness of the assessor's valuation where the sales price was not the result of an arms'-length transaction because of the taxpayers' mailing campaign to convince landowners to sell their property to the taxpayers at below market prices. In re Cobb, 1991-NMCA-122, 113 N.M. 251, 824 P.2d 1053, cert. denied, 113 N.M. 44, 822 P.2d 1127.  
Taxpayers challenge of their property assessment, which proposed an alternative assessment method, failed to present sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption that the original assessment was correct.

Compiler's notes. — The phrase "this act" at the end of the section refers to Laws 1997, ch. 68, which amended this section.  
The 1997 amendment, effective June 20, 1997, substituted "7-36-21" and the language following it for "72-29-10 NMSA 1953" at the end of the section.  
Appropriate time period to establish exemption status. — The prior calendar year is the appropriate time period upon which to base a property’s exemption status, and January 1 is the appropriate “cutoff date” under Article VIII, Section 3 of the New Mexico Constitution. CAVU Co. v. Martinez, 2014-NMSC-029, aff'g in part, rev'g in part 2013-NMCA-050, 302 P.3d 126.  
Evidence of the use of property on the valuation date. — The valuation date of January 1 sets a cut-off date to avoid reclassification of property throughout the tax year. It does not specify the date on which the property’s use defines its status for the remainder of the year and does not limit the evidence that can be considered in determining the status of property to the property’s use on January 1. Property does not have to be in active use for exempt purposes on January 1 in order for an exemption to apply and evidence of the prior use of the property should be considered. CAVU Co. v. Martinez, 2013-NMCA-050, 302 P.3d 126, cert. granted, 2013-NMCERT-004.  
Where the taxpayer’s property was used as a school until May 2008, the property ceased to be used actively as a school after May, 2008 and was not used actively as a school again until August 2010 when the fall semester began; the property was not used for educational purposes on January 1, 2010; and the district court held that January 1 is the point at which the status of property is determined for purposes of qualifying for an exemption from taxation and that the taxpayer’s property was not exempt for the 2010 tax year because the property was not used for educational purposes on January 1, 2010, the district court erred in interpreting Section 7-38-7 NMSA 1978 too narrowly and should have considered the use of the property prior to January 1, 2010. CAVU Co. v. Martinez, 2013-NMCA-050, 302 P.3d 126, cert. granted, 2013-NMCERT-004.  
Exclusive reliance on evidence of prior year comparable sales was reasonable. — With respect to comparable sales, the legislature intended assessors and protests boards to consider only data available on January 1 of the tax year of the valuation notice. AMREP Sw., Inc. v. Sandoval Cnty. Assessor, 2012-NMCA-082, 284 P.3d 1118.  
Where the county valuation protests board refused to consider the taxpayer’s comparable 2009 sales evidence and relied exclusively on comparable 2008 sales for the valuation of the taxpayer’s property for the 2009 tax year based on the board’s interpretation of statutory and administrative code provisions that required property to be valued using only data available on January 1, 2009, the board’s interpretation of the statutory and administrative code provisions was reasonable. AMREP Sw., Inc. v. Sandoval Cnty. Assessor, 2012-NMCA-082, 284 P.3d 1118.  
Past or future value not to serve as basis. — What the fair market value of a tract may have been in the past or speculation as to what it might be in the future cannot serve as the basis for valuation. Petition of Kinscherff, 1976-NMCA-097, 89 N.M. 669,

Tax liability whether or not property evaluation done on time. — When property is evaluated in accordance with the law, the taxpayer is liable for payment, whether or not the evaluation is done on time, just so long as the value determined reflects the value as of January 1st of the tax year.

(1) a basic allocation formula that prorates value on the basis of the amount of time that the tangible personal property is in the state and subject to valuation for property taxation purposes;  
(2) determining proration of value under Paragraph (1) of this subsection using estimates of the amount of time that the tangible personal property will be in the state to cover those situations in which tangible personal property is imported for an indeterminate time during a tax year; and  
(3) a method of allocating the value of the tangible personal property among different governmental units when the tangible personal property is located in more than one governmental unit.  
E. Any person who intentionally refuses to make a report required of him under this section or who knowingly makes a false statement in a report required under this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by imposition of a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000).

The report required by this subsection shall be made by the owner of the property or such other person as may be authorized by rules of the department. The report shall be in a form and contain the information required by rules of the department. It shall be made not later than the last day of February in the tax year in which the property is subject to valuation. Claims of economic obsolescence or functional obsolescence on properties not regulated by the federal government shall be made at the time the annual report is filed; however, the department shall accept supplements to the annual report containing claims of economic obsolescence or functional obsolescence on properties regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission or its successor agency at the time the annual commission report becomes available, but no later than April 15 of the tax year or at a later time allowed by an extension granted by the department.

B. Except as provided in Subsection D of this section, all property subject to valuation for property taxation purposes by the county assessor shall be reported as follows:  
(1) property valued in the 1974 tax year by the county assessor need not be reported for any subsequent tax year unless required to be reported under Paragraph (3) of this subsection;  
(2) property not valued in the 1974 tax year by the county assessor but that becomes subject to valuation by the county assessor in any subsequent tax year shall be reported to the county assessor not later than the last day of February of the tax year in which it becomes subject to valuation, but such property need not be reported for any year subsequent to the year in which initially reported unless required to be reported under Paragraph (3) of this subsection;  
(3) property once valued by a county assessor in a tax year, but which is not valued for a year subsequent to the year of initial valuation because it is not subject to valuation for that subsequent year by the county assessor, shall be reported to the county assessor not later than the last day of February in a tax year in which it again becomes subject to valuation by the county assessor; and  
(4) reports required under Paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection shall be in a form and contain the information required by rules of the department.

G. A person who intentionally refuses to make a report required under the provisions of Subsection A, B or C of this section or who knowingly makes a false statement in a report required under the provisions of Subsection A, B or C of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be punished by the imposition of a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000).

This penalty shall not be considered a delinquent property tax, and the provisions of the Property Tax Code for the enforcement and collection of delinquent property taxes through the sale of the property do not apply. However, the county treasurer may use all other methods provided by law to collect the property tax or penalty due. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Property Tax Code, amounts collected pursuant to the penalty provided by this subsection shall be distributed among 
jurisdictions imposing tax on the property in the same proportion as the amount of tax ultimately determined to be due for the jurisdiction bears to the total due for all such jurisdictions.  
K. The civil penalties authorized under Subsections H and I of this section shall be imposed and collected at the time and in the manner that the tax is imposed and collected. In order to assist in the imposition and collection of the penalties, the persons having responsibility for determining the value of the property shall make an entry in the valuation records indicating the liability for any penalties due under this section.

Notice not intended for relief or advantage of taxpayer. — The requirement that the county treasurer (now the county assessor) give written notice to each taxpayer of the amount of his tax adds nothing to the definite imposition of the tax and the equally definite imposition of a penalty to follow upon delinquency. It is intended for the benefit and convenience of the taxpayer, but certainly not for his relief or advantage. Greene v. Esquibel, 1954-NMSC-039, 58 N.M. 429, 272 P.2d 330.

7-38-20.1. Temporary provision; additional instructions to assessors and treasurers; special requirements for 2004 veteran exemption; newly eligible veterans. 
A. A county assessor shall include with the notice of valuation distributed to property owners for the 2005 property tax year, a notice to taxpayers informing them that:  
(1) a taxpayer who is a veteran or the unmarried surviving spouse of a veteran who was not previously eligible for a veteran property tax exemption may be eligible for that exemption due to the change in Article 8, Section 5 of the constitution of New Mexico adopted in November 2004; and  
(2) a taxpayer who is eligible for the veteran tax exemption for the 2005 property tax year may also be eligible for the veteran tax exemption for the 2004 property tax year.  
B. The taxpayer shall obtain certification from the veterans' services department verifying that the veteran upon whose service the exemption is claimed is eligible for a tax exemption pursuant to Article 8, Section 5 of the constitution of New Mexico for the 2005 property tax year to present to the county assessor. The veterans' services department shall certify the date on which the veteran became honorably discharged from the armed forces of the United States.  
C. The county assessor shall determine from the date of discharge from the armed forces of the United States certified by the veterans' services department if the veteran would have been eligible to receive a tax exemption for the 2004 property tax year based on the veteran's date of discharge from the armed forces of the United States and the dates on which the taxpayer took title to the property. A veteran would be eligible if the veteran were discharged on a date prior to the thirtieth day following the date on which the county assessor mailed the notice of valuation in 2004 and had title to the property to which the veteran tax exemption is applied at that time.  
D. If a taxpayer, who became eligible for the veteran exemption due to the approval of the amendment to Article 8, Section 5 of the constitution of New Mexico, qualifies for the 2004 and 2005 veteran exemptions and has paid in full the taxpayer's property tax liability for the 2004 property tax year, for the 2005 property tax year only the county assessor shall combine the total of the veteran exemptions for those two property tax years and deduct the combined total from the taxable value of the taxpayer's property to obtain the net taxable value for the 2005 property tax year.

Denial of charitable property tax exemption upheld. — Where the Santa Fe county assessor appealed the district court’s decision that petitioner, a retirement and continuing care community, was improperly denied a charitable property tax exemption, the New Mexico supreme court held that the district court erred in concluding that petitioner fulfilled the charitable use requirements for tax exemption under art. VIII, § 3 of the New Mexico constitution, because petitioner, a self-sustaining community that accepts and benefits only financially and medically screened residents based on requirements calculated in the interests of financial security for itself, did not create any substantial public benefit and therefore cannot be entitled to exemption from taxation under 7-36-7(B)(1)(d) NMSA 1978 or N.M. Const., art. VIII, § 3. El Castillo Ret. Residences v. Martinez, 2017-NMSC-026, aff’g 2015-NMCA-041, and overruling La Vida Llena v. Montoya, 2013-NMCA-048, 299 P.3d 456.  
Constitutional issues are outside the county protests board’s statutory authority. — It is the duty of the judiciary to interpret the constitution, the supreme law of the land, and to set forth the law; a county protests board does not have jurisdiction to hear constitutional issues which are outside the protests board’s statutory authority. El Castillo Retirement Residences v. Martinez, 2015-NMCA-041, overruling In re Miller, 1975-NMCA-116, 88 N.M. 492, 542 P.2d 1182, rev’d on other grounds, 1976-NMSC-039, 89 N.M. 547, 555 P.2d 142, and cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-004.  
Where retirement community was denied a charitable property tax exemption by the county assessor and appealed the county assessor’s decision to the Santa Fe county protests board, claiming a charitable property tax exemption under N.M. Const., art. VIII, § 3, it was appropriate for the protests board to decline to hear the constitutional claim, citing a lack of jurisdiction. El Castillo Retirement Residences v. Martinez, 2015-NMCA-041, overruling In re Miller, 1975-NMCA-116, 88 N.M. 492, 542 P.2d 1182, rev’d on other grounds, 1976-NMSC-039, 89 N.M. 547, 555 P.2d 142, and cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-004.  
Failure of officials to equalize assessments does not establish interpretation. — The fact that state officials have, for years, known that there are inequalities or lack of uniformity in tax assessments, and have done nothing about it, does not establish this as official "long-standing interpretation." It is, in essence, merely long-standing failure by respondents and their predecessors to require equalization as plainly required by the constitution and the legislative enactments. State ex rel.

A hearing officer shall be designated by the chief hearing officer of the administrative hearings office to conduct the hearing.  
B. Final action taken by the hearing officer on a petition shall be by written order. The hearing officer's order shall be made within thirty days after the date of the hearing, but this time limitation may be extended by agreement of the department and the protestant. A copy of the order shall be sent immediately by certified mail to the property owner. A copy of the order shall also be sent to the county assessor.  
C. All protests shall be decided within one hundred twenty days of the date the protest is filed unless the parties otherwise agree. The protest shall be denied if the property owner or the property owner's authorized representative fails, without reasonable justification, to appear at the hearing.

E. Changes in the valuation records shall clearly indicate that the prior entry has been superseded by an order of the hearing officer.  
F. The department shall maintain a file of all orders made pursuant to this section. The file shall be open for public inspection.

Protests board to hear any grounds for protest. — When the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, the statute must be given its literal meaning. The language of this section and Section 7-38-25 NMSA 1978 (formerly 72-2-37 and 72-2-38, 1953 Comp.) clearly and unambiguously gives to the county valuation protests boards the duty to hear a protest of the valuation of a taxpayer's property on any grounds whatsoever, including the grounds of allegedly unconstitutional discrimination in comparison with assessments of other properties. In re Miller, 1975-NMCA-116, 88 N.M. 492, 542 P.2d 1182, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70, rev'd on other grounds, 1976-NMSC-039, 89 N.M. 547, 555 P.2d 142.

Court intervention required upon board's lack of reasoned decision-making. — A court's supervisory function calls on it to intervene with the protest board not merely in case of procedural inadequacies, or a bypassing of the mandate in the legislative charter, but more broadly if the court becomes aware, especially from a combination of danger signals, that the board has not really taken a hard look at the salient problems and has not genuinely engaged in reasoned decision-making.

The county valuation protests board is a quasi-judicial body. Addis v. Santa Fe Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1977-NMCA-122, 91 N.M. 165, 571 P.2d 822.  
Board must act in session with quorum. — When a duty is entrusted to a board composed of different individuals, that board can act officially only as such, in convened session, with the members, or a quorum thereof, present. Petition of Kinscherff, 1976-NMCA-097, 89 N.M. 669, 556 P.2d 355, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 8, 558 P.2d 620.  
Quorum must be present before county valuation protests board can act officially and any act done with less than a quorum present is invalid. Petition of Kinscherff, 1976-NMCA-097, 89 N.M. 669, 556 P.2d 355, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 8, 558 P.2d 620.

Quorum not present when not enough members on board. — When the protests board, consisting of three members, instead of the six required by the prior version of this section, heard the protests and entered the orders, a quorum was not present, and the orders of the board were invalid. San Pedro S. Group v. Bernalillo Cnty. Valuation Protest Bd., 1976-NMCA-116, 89 N.M. 784, 558 P.2d 53.  
Common-law rule of quorum applies in absence of statute. — Under the former version of this section a quorum of the voting members present was not sufficient for the hearing to be the official act of the board since absent any such statutory provisions the common-law rule that a majority of all of the members of a board or commission shall constitute a quorum applied. Petition of Kinscherff, 1976-NMCA-097, 89 N.M. 669, 556 P.2d 355, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 8, 558 P.2d 620.  
Denial of charitable property tax exemption upheld. — Where the Santa Fe county assessor appealed the district court’s decision that petitioner, a retirement and continuing care community, was improperly denied a charitable property tax exemption, the New Mexico supreme court held that the district court erred in concluding that petitioner fulfilled the charitable use requirements for tax exemption under art. VIII, § 3 of the New Mexico constitution, because petitioner, a self-sustaining community that accepts and benefits only financially and medically screened residents based on requirements calculated in the interests of financial security for itself, did not create any substantial public benefit and therefore cannot be entitled to exemption from taxation under 7-36-7(B)(1)(d) NMSA 1978 or N.M. Const., art. VIII, § 3. El Castillo Ret. Residences v. Martinez, 2017-NMSC-026, aff’g 2015-NMCA-041, and overruling La Vida Llena v. Montoya, 2013-NMCA-048, 299 P.3d 456.  
Constitutional issues are outside the county protests board’s statutory authority. — It is the duty of the judiciary to interpret the constitution, the supreme law of the land, and to set forth the law; a county protests board does not have jurisdiction to hear constitutional issues which are outside the protests board’s statutory authority. El Castillo Retirement Residences v. Martinez, 2015-NMCA-041, overruling In re Miller, 1975-NMCA-116, 88 N.M. 492, 542 P.2d 1182, rev’d on other grounds, 1976-NMSC-039, 89 N.M. 547, 555 P.2d 142, and cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-004.  
Where retirement community was denied a charitable property tax exemption by the county assessor and appealed the county assessor’s decision to the Santa Fe county protests board, claiming a charitable property tax exemption under N.M. Const., art. VIII, § 3, it was appropriate for the protests board to decline to hear the constitutional claim, citing a lack of jurisdiction. El Castillo Retirement Residences v. Martinez, 2015-NMCA-041, overruling In re Miller, 1975-NMCA-116, 88 N.M. 492, 542 P.2d 1182, rev’d on other grounds, 1976-NMSC-039, 89 N.M. 547, 555 P.2d 142, and cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-004.  
Protests board to hear any grounds for protest. — When the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, the statute must be given its literal meaning. The language of Section 7-38-24 NMSA 1978 and this section (formerly 72-2-37 and 72-2-38, 1953 Comp.) clearly and unambiguously gives to the county valuation protests boards the duty to hear a protest of the valuation of a taxpayer's property on any grounds whatsoever, including the grounds of allegedly unconstitutional discrimination in comparison with assessments of other properties. El Castillo Retirement Residences v. Martinez, 2015-NMCA-041, overruling In re Miller, 1975-NMCA-116, 88 N.M. 492, 542 P.2d 1182, rev’d on other grounds, 1976-NMSC-039, 89 N.M. 547, 555 P.2d 142, and cert. granted, 2015-NMCERT-004.

7-38-26. Scheduling of protest hearings. 
Before scheduling a protest hearing, the county assessor shall notify the director and assure that the assigned property appraisal officer board member will be made available. The director may assign a property appraisal officer to act as a member of more than one county valuation protests board. He also may establish and publish schedules for hearings on protests in the various counties to make the most efficient use of assigned property appraisal officers and assure the expeditious determination of protests.

7-38-27. Protest hearings; verbatim record; action by county valuation protests board; time limitations. 
A. Except for the rules relating to discovery, the technical rules of evidence and the Rules Civil Procedure for the District Courts do not apply at protest hearings before a county valuation protests board, but the hearing shall be conducted so that an ample opportunity is provided for the presentation of complaints and defenses. All testimony shall be taken under oath. A verbatim record of the hearing shall be made but need not be transcribed unless required for appeal purposes.  
B. Final action taken by the board on a petition shall be by written order signed by the chairman or a member of the board designated by the chairman. The order shall be made within thirty days after the date of the hearing, but this time limitation may be extended by agreement of the board and the protestant. A copy of the order shall be sent immediately by certified mail to the property owner. A copy of the order shall also be sent to the director and the county assessor.  
C. All protests shall be decided within one hundred eighty days of the date the protest is filed. The protest shall be denied if the property owner or his authorized representative fails, without reasonable justification, to appear at the hearing.  
D. The board's order shall be dated, state the changes to be made in the valuation records, if any, and direct the county assessor to take appropriate action. The division shall make any changes in its valuation records required by the order.  
E. Changes in the valuation records shall clearly indicate that the prior entry has been superseded by an order of the board.  
F. The assessor shall maintain a file of all orders made by the county valuation protests board. The file shall be open for public inspection.  
G. If an order of a county valuation protests board is appealed under Section 7-38-28 NMSA 1978, the director shall immediately notify the appropriate county assessor of the appeal. Notations shall be made in the valuation records of the assessor and the division indicating the pendency of the appeal.

ANNOTATIONS 
Cross references. — For rules relating to discovery, see Rule 1-026 NMRA et seq.  
Procedural due process denied when board excluded evidence. — By unlawfully excluding evidence and denying the right to discovery, the county valuation protests boards curtailed taxpayers' right to be heard and to present any defense, and, in so doing, they deprived appellants of their constitutionally guaranteed right to procedural due process. Taxpayers are entitled to new hearings, at which evidence of valuation of comparable properties or other properties of the same class may be admissible in evidence and are to be weighed by the boards in arriving at their decisions. In re Miller, 1975-NMCA-116, 88 N.M. 492, 542 P.2d 1182, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70, rev'd on other grounds, 1976-NMSC-039, 89 N.M. 547, 555 P.2d 142.  
Refusal to allow witnesses. — A notion of fairness is included within the concept of procedural due process, and accordingly in a hearing before an administrative agency, the agency must examine both sides of the controversy taking and weighing the 
evidence that is offered and finding facts based on a consideration of the evidence, in order to fairly protect the interests and rights of all who are involved; a refusal to allow witnesses to be called is a denial of procedural due process. In re Miller, 1975-NMCA-116, 88 N.M. 492, 542 P.2d 1182, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70, rev'd on other grounds, 1976-NMSC-039, 89 N.M. 547, 555 P.2d 142.  
Denial of right to take depositions. — To deny the taxpayer the right to take depositions at county valuation protests board hearings denies him the right to a fair hearing. Such denial constitutes a denial of due process under U.S. Const., amend. XIV. In re Miller, 1975-NMCA-116, 88 N.M. 492, 542 P.2d 1182, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70, rev'd on other grounds, 1976-NMSC-039, 89 N.M. 547, 555 P.2d 142.  
Arbitrary for board to reach decision without considering all evidence. — The state has not given administrative boards the authority to catalogue which evidence shall be considered in deciding a protest, and when the administrative board has reached a decision and promulgated an order without considering all the evidence presented at the hearing, its decision and order is arbitrary and should be reversed. In re Miller, 1975-NMCA-116, 88 N.M. 492, 542 P.2d 1182, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70, rev'd on other grounds, 1976-NMSC-039, 89 N.M. 547, 555 P.2d 142.  
Full opportunity to be heard required. — Administrative proceedings must conform to fundamental principles of justice and the requirements of due process of law; a litigant must be given a full opportunity to be heard with all rights related thereto. In re Miller, 1975-NMCA-116, 88 N.M. 492, 542 P.2d 1182, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70, rev'd on other grounds, 1976-NMSC-039, 89 N.M. 547, 555 P.2d 142.  
Rulings void if not in accord with statute. — Rulings by an administrative agency not in accord with the basic statutory requirements relating to the agency will render its decision void. La Jara Land Developers, Inc. v. Bernalillo County Assessor, 1982-NMCA-006, 97 N.M. 318, 639 P.2d 605.  
Administrative law rules of evidence govern admissions. — While neither the rules of evidence, the rules of civil procedure nor the rules provided by the Administrative Procedures Act apply, there must be some rules to govern admission of evidence in proceedings before the county valuation protests boards, and these rules must be found in the body of administrative law that has grown up in the courts. In re Miller, 1975-NMCA-116, 88 N.M. 492, 542 P.2d 1182, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70, rev'd on other grounds, 1976-NMSC-039, 89 N.M. 547, 555 P.2d 142.  
Wide latitude allowed in admission of evidence. — The rationale for stating that the technical rules of evidence do not apply at protest hearings before a county valuation protests board is to allow wide latitude in the admission of evidence before an administrative board. In re Miller, 1975-NMCA-116, 88 N.M. 492, 542 P.2d 1182, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70, rev'd on other grounds, 1976-NMSC-039, 89 N.M. 547, 555 P.2d 142.  
Administrative Procedures Act (Sections 12-8-1 to 12-8-25 NMSA 1978) demonstrates that depositions are permissible under administrative law, to assist the agency and other parties in obtaining a fair hearing. In re Miller, 1975-NMCA-116, 88 N.M. 492, 542 P.2d 1182, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70, rev'd on other grounds, 1976-NMSC-039, 89 N.M. 547, 555 P.2d 142.  
Taxpayer's evidence should be admitted to prove value. — The protests board could not rely exclusively on the county assessor's valuation of property even though according to former 72-2-3, 1953 Comp., the assessment must be at "full actual value," and neither could it rely on comparable sales or sales of comparable lands where none have occurred; accordingly, the board should have allowed the admission of the only available relevant evidence which the taxpayer had. In situations where cash market value could not be determined, earning capacity, cost of reproduction and original cost less depreciation furnished relevant considerations for determining "value." In re Miller, 1975-NMCA-116, 88 N.M. 492, 542 P.2d 1182, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70, rev'd on other grounds, 1976-NMSC-039, 89 N.M. 547, 555 P.2d 142.  
Rules of weight, etc., not necessarily limited. — Although the technical rules of evidence and the rules of civil procedure do not apply at protest hearings before a county valuation protests board, the rules relating to weight, applicability or materiality of evidence are not thus limited. San Pedro S. Group v. Bernalillo Cnty. Valuation Protest Bd., 1976-NMCA-116, 89 N.M. 784, 558 P.2d 53.  
Rules of weight, etc., not necessarily limited. — The rules relating to weight, applicability or materiality of evidence are not limited by the provisions of this section. Petition of Kinscherff, 1976-NMCA-097, 89 N.M. 669, 556 P.2d 355, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 8, 558 P.2d 620.  
Requirement for findings. — By inadvertence, the legislature omitted the requirement of a "decision" by the board under this section. However, the practical reasons for requiring administrative findings are so powerful that the requirement has been imposed with remarkable uniformity by virtually all federal and state courts, irrespective of a statutory requirement. First Nat'l Bank v. Bernalillo Cnty. Valuation Protest Bd., 1977-NMCA-005, 90 N.M. 110, 560 P.2d 174 (decided under prior law).  
Pronouncement not final order subject to review on appeal. — Statements of a judge as to reasons for the judgment, made before the judgment is entered, which statements are not embodied therein, cannot be considered as a part of the judgment but are merely evidence of what the court had decided to do, a decision that the trial court can change at any time before the entry of a final judgment and an order of a protest board is analogous to the judgment of a court. Therefore, a pronouncement of a county protests board did not constitute its duly entered final order and was not subject to review on appeal of its final order. Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.  
Board must show good cause for delay in hearing. — When taxpayers show that the statutory time constraints have not been complied with and the taxpayer and board have not agreed to extend the time, the burden shifts to the board to establish good cause for the delay. Protest of Plaza Del Sol Ltd. P'ship v. Assessor for Cnty. of Bernalillo, 1986-NMCA-022, 104 N.M. 154, 717 P.2d 1123.  
Settlement negotiations do not toll time requirements. — Mere settlement negotiations, without more, are insufficient as a matter of law to toll the statutory time requirements. Protest of Plaza Del Sol Ltd. P'ship v. Assessor for Cnty. of Bernalillo, 1986-NMCA-022, 104 N.M. 154, 717 P.2d 1123.  
Orders invalid when board without quorum. — When the protests board, consisting of three members, instead of the six required by the prior version of Section 7-38-25 NMSA 1978, heard the protests and entered the orders, a quorum was not present, and the orders of the board were invalid. San Pedro S. Group v. Bernalillo Cnty. Valuation Protest Bd., 1976-NMCA-116, 89 N.M. 784, 558 P.2d 53.  
Protests board without authority to reject agreement between assessor and landowner. — A county valuation protests board does not have authority to reject an agreement between an assessor and a landowner concerning the land value. In re Horn, 1980-NMCA-145, 95 N.M. 38, 618 P.2d 382.  
Decisions have force and effect of judgments. — The decisions rendered by an officer or a board legally constituted and empowered to settle the question submitted to it, when acting judicially, have the force and effect of a judgment. Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.  
7-38-28. Appeals from orders of the county valuation protests boards. 
A property owner may appeal an order made by a county valuation protests board by filing an appeal pursuant to the provisions of Section 39-3-1.1 NMSA 1978.  
History: 1953 Comp., § 72-31-28, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 258, § 68; 1978 Comp., § 7-38-28; 1982, ch. 28, § 15; 1990, ch. 22, § 3; 1998, ch. 55, § 19; 1999, ch. 265, § 19; 2015, ch. 73, § 22; 2023, ch. 36, § 8.

Cross references. — For procedures governing administrative appeals to the district court, see Rule 1-074 NMRA.  
The 2023 amendment, effective July 1, 2023, revised the process for appeals from orders of county valuation protests boards; in the section heading, deleted "hearing officer or"; and after "order made by", deleted "a hearing officer or"; and deleted "The director shall notify the appropriate county assessor of the decision and order of the

The 2015 amendment, effective July 1, 2015, authorized property owners to appeal orders made by hearing officers from the administrative hearings office; in the catchline, after "orders of the", deleted "director" and added "hearing officer"; and in Subsection A, after "order made by", deleted "the director" and added "a hearing officer".

The 1998 amendment, effective September 1, 1998, rewrote Subsection A, deleted former Subsection B and redesignated former Subsection C as Subsection B; and in present Subsection B, inserted "district" and deleted "of appeals" following "court".  
The 1990 amendment, effective May 16, 1990, in Subsection A, substituted "thirty days" for "forty-five days" and inserted "or such other time prescribed by the Rules of Appellate Procedure, NMRA" in the first sentence, substituted "shall be" for "must be" and added "and shall not be de novo" at the end of the second sentence and added the third sentence; deleted former Subsections B and C, relating to the record on appeal; and redesignated former Subsections D and E as Subsections B and C.  
Lack of jurisdiction at any stage of the proceedings is a controlling consideration which must be resolved before going further, and an appellate court may raise the question of jurisdiction on its own motion. Petition of Kinscherff, 1976-NMCA-097, 89 N.M. 669, 556 P.2d 355, cert. denied, 90 N.M. 8, 558 P.2d 620.  
Court bound by substantial evidence of record. — If there is substantial evidence in the record to support a decision of a county valuation protests board, the appellate court is bound thereby, and, in deciding if there is substantial evidence to support the decision, it must view the evidence in the most favorable light to support the finding, reversing only if convinced that the evidence thus viewed, together with all reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, cannot sustain the finding. Further, only favorable evidence and the inferences to be drawn therefrom will be considered, and any evidence unfavorable to the findings will not be considered. In re Miller, 1975-NMCA-116, 88 N.M. 492, 542 P.2d 1182, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70.  
District court acted outside its proper appellate jurisdiction. — Where petitioner, a retirement and continuing care community, appealed to the district court the Santa Fe county valuation protests board’s (board) decision upholding the county assessor’s denial of petitioner’s request for a property tax exemption, the district court erred in exercising its original jurisdiction over the statutory claim and issuing new findings of fact which contradicted the findings of the board; the district court should have exercised its appellate jurisdiction over the board’s determination regarding the applicability of 7-36-7(B)(1)(d) NMSA 1978 to petitioner and reviewed whether the board’s decision was arbitrary and capricious, unsupported by substantial evidence, or 
otherwise contrary to law as required under 39-3-1.1(D) NMSA 1978. El Castillo Ret. Residences v. Martinez, 2017-NMSC-026, aff’g 2015-NMCA-041, and overruling La Vida Llena v. Montoya, 2013-NMCA-048, 299 P.3d 456.  
Pronouncement of board not subject to review on appeal. — Statements of a judge as to reasons for the judgment, made before the judgment is entered, which statements are not embodied therein, cannot be considered as a part of the judgment, but are merely evidence of what the court had decided to do, a decision that the trial court can change at any time before the entry of a final judgment, and an order of a protest board is analogous to the judgment of a court; therefore, a pronouncement of a county protests board did not constitute its duly entered final order and was not subject to review on appeal of its final order. Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.  
Decision arbitrary if board has not considered all evidence. — The state has not given administrative boards the authority to catalogue which evidence shall be considered in deciding a protest, and when the administrative board has reached a decision and promulgated an order without considering all the evidence presented at the hearing, its decision and order is arbitrary and should be reversed. In re Miller, 1975-NMCA-116, 88 N.M. 492, 542 P.2d 1182, cert. denied, 89 N.M. 5, 546 P.2d 70.  
Rulings void if not in accord with statute. — Rulings by an administrative agency not in accord with the basic statutory requirements relating to the agency will render its decision void. La Jara Land Developers, Inc. v. Bernalillo Cnty. Assessor, 1982-NMCA-006, 97 N.M. 318, 639 P.2d 605.  
When county assessor did not follow any statutory method of valuation in 1976, but simply set the valuation of a shopping center back up to the 1972 figure, it was held that the decisions of the board were arbitrary and capricious, not supported by substantial evidence in the record taken as a whole, and otherwise not in accordance with law, and its orders were vacated. San Pedro S. Group v. Bernalillo Cnty. Valuation Protest Bd., 1976-NMCA-116, 89 N.M. 784, 558 P.2d 53.  
Court has no duty to search for authority supporting argument. — When taxpayer cited no authority to support its argument that the assessor's evidence of sales of certain property did not involve comparable sales, the appellate court had no duty to search for authority or consider taxpayer's claim unless it was apparent on the face of the claimed error that it had merit. Peterson Props. v. Valencia Cnty. Valuation Protests Bd., 1976-NMCA-043, 89 N.M. 239, 549 P.2d 1074.  
Judicial review based on whole record. — Judicial review of decisions by agencies are based on the whole record. This requires the courts to review and consider not only evidence in support of one party's contention, but also to look at evidence which is contrary to the finding; the reviewing court must then decide whether, on balance, the agency's decision was supported by substantial evidence. Cibola Energy Corp. v. Roselli, 1987-NMCA-055, 105 N.M. 774, 737 P.2d 555.  
Necessity of findings of fact and conclusions of law. — For purposes of judicial review, the order must, at least, indicate the reasoning of the board and the basis on which it acted; the expense incurred by having findings of fact and conclusions of law would be repaid 10-fold by the expense and energy saved on judicial review. Cibola Energy Corp. v. Roselli, 1987-NMCA-055, 105 N.M. 774, 737 P.2d 555.  
Exhaustion of administrative remedies. — The legislature, in enacting a comprehensive scheme for administrative and judicial review, has provided the exclusive remedy for claims presented to the district court that property owned by all masonic lodges is exempt for taxation under N.M. Const., art. VIII, § 3, and the administrative remedies provided by the legislature must be exhausted before a declaratory judgment action will lie. Grand Lodge of Ancient & Accepted Masons v. Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1987-NMCA-081, 106 N.M. 179, 740 P.2d 1163, cert. denied, 106 N.M. 174, 740 P.2d 1158.  
Taxpayer effectively rebutted presumption. — When taxpayer's valuation is supported by the whole record in that after rebutting the assessor's valuation and presenting a prima facie case for its own valuation the board failed to rebut taxpayer's appraisal, the decision of the board will be reversed and remanded with instructions that the board enter judgment for taxpayer in favor of its valuations.

7-38-28.1.  Appeals from decisions and orders of the hearing officer of the administrative hearings office. 
A. A property owner or the secretary may appeal a decision and order of a hearing officer of the administrative hearings office to the court of appeals for further relief, but only to the same extent and on the same theory as was asserted in the hearing before the hearing officer.  All such appeals shall be on the record made at the hearing and shall not be de novo.  All such appeals shall be taken within thirty days of the date of mailing or delivery of the written decision and order of the hearing officer to the property owner, and, if not so taken, the decision and order are conclusive. 
B. The procedure for perfecting an appeal pursuant to this section shall be as provided by the Rules of Appellate Procedure. 
C. On appeal, the court shall set aside a decision and order of the hearing officer only if the decision and order is found to be: 
(1) arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion; 
(2) not supported by substantial evidence in the record; or 
(3) otherwise not in accordance with the law. 
D. If the secretary appeals a decision and order of the hearing officer and the court's decision, from which either no appeal is taken or no appeal may be taken, upholds the decision of the hearing officer, the court shall award reasonable attorney fees to the property owner.  If the court's decision upholds the hearing officer's decision only in part, the award shall be limited to reasonable attorney fees associated with the portion upheld.  
E. The secretary shall notify the appropriate county assessor of any decision and order or appellate court opinion and shall direct the assessor to take appropriate action to comply with the decision and order.

Where the Eddy county assessor sought to use funds from the county property valuation fund to contract with a private company for technical assistance in locating and valuing oil and gas property within Eddy county, this section does not prohibit the Eddy county commission from approving a contract with an independent contractor to assist the county assessor in valuing property, because the legislature made no attempt to restrict an assessor’s discretion on the use of the fund and thus intended to leave it to the professional discretion of county assessors to decide how best to achieve the statutory goal of current and correct valuation of all property within the county.

The department shall change its valuation records accordingly.  
E. Upon the final determination of the property owner's claim filed against the county assessor, the assessor shall send a copy of the final order to the county treasurer and to the director.

The sixty day period for bringing suit for a property tax refund does not violate due process. Chan v. Montoya, 2011-NMCA-072, 150 N.M. 44, 256 P.3d 987, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-005, 150 N.M. 666, 265 P.3d 717.  
The time limit for filing a property tax refund complaint begins to run on the date the tax payment is due, not the date the payment becomes delinquent. Chan v. Montoya, 2011-NMCA-072, 150 N.M. 44, 256 P.3d 987, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-005, 150 N.M. 666, 265 P.3d 717.  
Time limit for filing complaint for refund. — Where taxpayers received property tax bills which stated that the first of two installments of the annual tax payment was due on November 10, 2007, and that the first installment payment would become delinquent on December 10, 2007; taxpayers paid the installment; and taxpayers filed a complaint for a refund in February 2008, approximately ninety days after the November 10th due date, taxpayers’ claims for refund were untimely and barred by the sixty day limitation period. Chan v. Montoya, 2011-NMCA-072, 150 N.M. 44, 256 P.3d 987, cert. denied, 2011-NMCERT-005, 150 N.M. 666, 265 P.3d 717.  
Refund claims asserted in supplemental complaint. — A claim for subsequent year's taxes, asserted in a supplemental complaint in a tax refund suit, was not timely where the supplemental complaint was filed six weeks after the deadline under Section 7-38-40(A)(1) NMSA 1978 for claiming a refund. Dale Bellamah Land Co. v. Bernalillo Cnty., 1978-NMSC-095, 92 N.M. 615, 592 P.2d 971.  
Applicability. — This section applies to property that is subject to valuation. Property constitutionally exempt from property taxes is not to be valued for property tax purposes and therefore refund claims for exempt property are not viable under this section. Lovelace Ctr. for Health Sciences v. Beach, 1980-NMCA-004, 93 N.M. 793, 606 P.2d 203.

7-38-41. Protested property taxes; suspense fund; refunds; interest. 
A. Each county treasurer shall establish a fund to be known as the "property tax suspense fund." The portion of any property taxes paid to the county treasurer that is not admitted to be due and is the subject of a claim for refund shall be deposited in this fund.  
B. The fund shall be invested in interest-earning securities, accounts or deposits that are legal investments for county funds under the law and regulations of the department of finance and administration. The county treasurer shall keep records of interest earned by the investment of the fund.  
C. If a property owner's property taxes are reduced as a result of a decrease in value of the property taxed, a change in the classification, a change in the allocation of the value of the property to a particular governmental unit or granting of a claim for an exemption ordered by a court after a claim for refund, the portion of the property taxes in controversy found to be in excess of the amount legally due and paid shall be refunded by the county treasurer to the property owner. The refund shall be made within fifteen days after the county treasurer receives a copy of the final order relating to the protest. The amount of property taxes in controversy found to be legally due and paid shall be distributed to the appropriate governmental units in accordance with the distribution regulations of the department of finance and administration. All payments authorized under this section shall be made from the property tax suspense fund.  
D. In addition to the payments authorized under Subsection C of this section, the county treasurer shall pay to the property owner and the governmental units their pro rata share of interest earned by the protested taxes computed by applying the earned interest rate of the fund to the principal amounts of refund and distribution for the period of time from the date of payment into the fund until a date not more than thirty days prior to the date the actual refund payment and distribution payment are made. Payments are considered made on the date a refund payment is mailed or delivered to the property owner and on the date a transfer occurs on the county treasurer's books showing a distribution payment.  
E. The department of finance and administration may authorize the transfer of any surplus interest accruing in the property tax suspense fund to the county general fund at the close of the fiscal year.

C.

In applying the foregoing requirements for applications of payments and in the adoption of any regulations to implement those provisions, the following additional rules shall apply:  
(1) applications of payments to a prior year's delinquent taxes, penalties and interest shall not be made for more than ten years prior to the year of payment unless the treasurer's records show that the property for which taxes are delinquent has been deeded to the state of New Mexico and that property has not been sold by the state pursuant to applicable law;  
(2) applications of payments to a prior year's delinquent taxes, penalties and interest shall not be made if:  
(a) the prior year for which the delinquent taxes, penalties or interest are due is not the immediately preceding tax year;  
(b) the delinquent taxes, penalties or interest are the result of real estate improvements that were omitted from property tax schedules in the prior year and listed and billed pursuant to Section 7-38-76 NMSA 1978;

(4) the failure of a receipting authority to apply a payment as required under this subsection or the failure to issue a required receipt to the taxpayer of the status of his account shall not relieve the taxpayer of liability for taxes, penalties or interest he would otherwise be required to pay nor does action or inaction by the receipting authority act to estop the collecting authority from taking any action to collect or enforce the payment of taxes, penalties and interest legally due.

(1) proceed immediately to determine the value of the property and send a notice of valuation to the property owner;  
(2) at any time after sending the notice of valuation proceed to determine the taxes due on the property by using the prior year's tax rates if the current year's tax rates have not been set and prepare and mail or deliver a property tax bill to the property owner and proceed to collect the taxes immediately; and  
(3) issue a demand warrant and proceed to collect unpaid taxes as delinquent taxes under the provisions of Sections 7-38-53 through 7-38-59 NMSA 1978 if taxes are not paid upon demand.

A. The New Mexico livestock board shall furnish to the department who shall forward to the county assessor of each county information obtained by it about the number, name and address of owner, description, movement, origin and destination of livestock being moved into or from any county. All such information shall be sent in duplicate to the county assessor into or from whose county livestock are being moved. Upon receipt of the information, the assessor shall send the duplicate to the department with a notation indicating the date on which it was received. The livestock board report made under this section fulfills the livestock owner's responsibility to make a report of the livestock under Section 7-36-21 NMSA 1978.  
B. Notwithstanding any other provision in the Property Tax Code to the contrary, either the county assessor or the director may:  
(1) determine the value of livestock for property taxation purposes at any time the livestock are subject to valuation under the Property Tax Code whether or not the owner of the livestock or any other person has reported them for valuation;  
(2) issue a notice of valuation of livestock at any time after a determination of valuation has been made of livestock for property taxation purposes;  
(3) prepare and deliver a tax bill and collect taxes on livestock at any time after a notice of valuation has been issued when there is reasonable cause to believe that it would jeopardize the collection of the taxes if the regular tax collection cycle in the Property Tax Code was followed; and  
(4) issue a demand warrant to enforce collection of taxes on livestock as delinquent taxes if there is reasonable cause to believe that the livestock may be moved out of the state prior to the payment of taxes, and proceed to collect the taxes as 
delinquent taxes by sale of the livestock in accordance with Sections 7-38-53 through 7-38-59 NMSA 1978.  
C. In the preparation of a tax bill under this section, the assessor or director may determine the tax due on the basis of the prior year's tax rates if the current year's tax rates have not yet been set. Taxes determined on livestock under this section are due when the tax bill is delivered to the owner or the person in charge of the livestock and are delinquent if not paid upon demand. Payment of taxes determined on the basis of the prior year's tax rates constitutes full payment of the taxes on the livestock for the current tax year.

A. Property taxes that are not paid within thirty days after the date on which they are due are delinquent unless a timely protest has been made under Sections 7-38-22 and 7-38-24 NMSA 1978, and in that case the amount of taxes attributable to the net taxable value of the property that is not in controversy becomes delinquent if not paid within thirty days after the due date.  
B. If property taxes would have otherwise been delinquent but for a timely protest having been made under Sections 7-38-22 and 7-38-24 NMSA 1978, property taxes are also delinquent if the property owner:  
(1) fails to pay his taxes or to appeal after a decision of a county valuation protests board, the director or a court within the time allowed for an appeal; or  
(2) fails to pay his taxes as ordered within ten days after the entry of a final order resulting from a timely protest when that order is not appealable.  
C. If a timely protest has been made under Sections 7-38-22 and 7-38-24 NMSA 1978, property taxes are also delinquent if the property owner fails to pay his taxes within thirty days after the date on which they are due if that date is later than the dates determined under Paragraph (1) or (2) of Subsection B of this section.  
D. Notice of the date when taxes become delinquent must be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the county at least once a week for the three weeks immediately preceding the week in which the delinquency date for first and 
second installments of property taxes due occurs. Each county treasurer shall cause the notice to be published for his county.

The lien runs in favor of the state and secures the payment of taxes on the real property and any penalty and interest that become due.

lien and paramount to any other interest in the property, perfected or unperfected. The annual taxing process provided for in the Property Tax Code shall continue as to any particular property regardless of prior tax delinquencies or of pending protests, actions for refunds or other tax controversies involving the property, including a sale for delinquent taxes.

Tax deeds prima facie valid. — Since tax deeds attacked were signed by the proper officials, they were prima facie valid unless some departure from statutory mandates, which made the conveyance a nullity and void, was established.

State has no standing to assert rights of owner. — The rights preserved in the statutes are rights of "owners" as that term is interpreted, and the state cannot bring itself within the protection of the sections. Unless the conveyances were void and a nullity, the state has no standing to assert rights given by statute to "owners" or "persons entitled to redeem." First Nat'l Bank v. State, 1967-NMSC-097, 77 N.M. 695, 427 P.2d 225.

Where plaintiffs owed delinquent property taxes; the department sold the property at auction; the department established the minimum bid as $215; the fair market value of the property was at least $25,000; the buyers of the property, who were the only bidders, paid $215 for the property; the department issued a tax deed to the buyers; and plaintiffs filed suit against the buyers to set aside the sale, the suit against the buyers was permissible. Valenzuela v. Snyder, 2014-NMCA-061, cert. granted, 2014-NMCERT-005.  
Inadequacy of purchase price. — The inadequacy of the purchase price or gross disproportionality between the purchase price and the property’s value are not grounds for setting aside a tax sale. Valenzuela v. Snyder, 2014-NMCA-061, cert. granted, 2014-NMCERT-005.  
Where plaintiffs owed delinquent property taxes; the department sold the property at auction; the department established the minimum bid as $215; the fair market value of the property was at least $25,000; the buyers of the property, who were the only bidders, paid $215 for the property; the department issued a tax deed to the buyers; and plaintiffs filed suit against the buyers to set aside the sale, the inadequacy of the purchase price or gross disproportionality between the purchase price and the 
property’s value were not unconscionable and were not grounds for setting aside the tax sale. Valenzuela v. Snyder, 2014-NMCA-061, cert. granted, 2014-NMCERT-005.  
Failure of proper notice would not invalidate sale. — If a valid assessment and levy had been made of the taxes, the county treasurer's failure to give a proper notice would not invalidate the tax sales. The neglect to give a proper notice or failure to give any notice at all would not discharge the tax or present a valid obstacle to the collection thereof. Greene v. Esquibel, 1954-NMSC-039, 58 N.M. 429, 272 P.2d 330.  
Continuity of adverse possession interrupted where land forfeited for taxes. — If, during the running of the statute of limitations in favor of the adverse occupant of land, the land is forfeited to the state for taxes, the general rule is that continuity of possession is interrupted for the reason that the statute of limitations does not run against the state in the absence of some special provision to that effect.

C. At the same time a notice required by Subsection A of this section is sent to the owner of the real property, a notice containing the information set out in Subsection B of this section shall also be sent to each person holding a lien or security interest of record in the property if an address for such person is reasonably ascertainable through a search of the property records of the county in which the property is located.

G. Proof that the owner has, by 5:00 p.m. of the day prior to the date of sale, entered into an installment agreement to pay all delinquent taxes, penalties, interest and costs as provided in Section 7-38-68 NMSA 1978 and that timely payments under such agreement are being made shall prevent or invalidate the sale.

I. The time requirements of this section are subject to the provisions of Section 7-38-83 NMSA 1978.  
History: 1953 Comp., § 72-31-66, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 258, § 106; 1980, ch. 104, § 1; 1982, ch. 28, § 23; 1983, ch. 215, § 4; 1990, ch. 22, § 8; 2001, ch. 253, § 2; 2001, ch. 254, § 2; 2018, ch. 50, § 2.  
ANNOTATIONS 
The 2018 amendment, effective May 16, 2018, provided procedures for the sale of abandoned real property for which delinquent property tax is due; in Subsection A, in the introductory clause, after "return receipt requested", added "and, for abandoned real property, an additional letter sent by first class mail", in Paragraph A(1), after "date of the sale", added the remainder of the paragraph, and in Paragraph A(2), after "Section 7-38-68 NMSA 1978", added the remainder of the paragraph; in Subsection B, added a new Paragraph B(3) and redesignated former Paragraphs B(3) through B(6) as Paragraphs B(4) through B(7), respectively, in Paragraph B(5), after "property owner of", deleted "his" and added "the property owner’s", and after "right to", deleted "enter into" and added "apply for", in Paragraph B(6), after "department the", deleted "taxpayer" and added "owner", and in Paragraph B(7), after "require by", deleted "regulation" and added "rule"; in Subsection C, after "owner of the", added "real"; in Subsection E, after "Proof", deleted "by the taxpayer"; added a new Subsection F and redesignated former Subsection F as Subsection G; in Subsection G, after "Proof", deleted "by the taxpayer", and after "that the", deleted "taxpayer" and added "owner"; and added Subsection H and redesignated former Subsection G as Subsection I.  
The 2001 amendment, effective June 15, 2001, in Paragraphs A(1), (2) and Subsection E, substituted "by 5:00 p.m. of the day prior to the date of sale" for "by the date of sale"; added Paragraphs B(4) and (5); in Subsection F, added "by 5:00 p.m. of the day prior to the date of sale" and deleted "prior to the date of sale" following "interests and costs"; and added Subsection G.  
The 1990 amendment, effective May 16, 1990, substituted "department" for "division" throughout the section; added Subsection C; redesignated former Subsections C to E as Subsections D to F; rewrote the provisions of Subsection D which read "Failure of the division to mail the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, or failure of the division to receive the return receipt shall invalidate the sale; provided, however, that the receipt by the division of a return receipt indicating that the taxpayer does not reside at the address shown on the most recent property tax schedule shall be deemed adequate notice and shall not invalidate the sale"; and made numerous minor stylistic changes.  
Taxpayer testimony insufficient to create issue of material fact. — In the face of documentary evidence establishing that the initial payment made by taxpayer for delinquent taxes corresponded to payment of one-half of his delinquent taxes, penalties, and interest, taxpayer's self-serving testimony as to his subjective belief that he had paid his taxes for certain tax years was insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to prior payment. Cordova v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't., 2005-NMCA-009, 136 N.M. 713, 104 P.3d 1104.  
Due process required. — A tax sale by the division is a taking of property by the government, and the notice of such taking must comply with minimum due process standards under the United States and New Mexico Constitutions. Patrick v. Rice, 1991-NMCA-063, 112 N.M. 285, 814 P.2d 463, cert. denied, 112 N.M. 308, 815 P.2d 161.  
Section 7-38-70C NMSA 1978 subject to notice requirements. — The legislature did not intend to apply Section 7-38-70C NMSA 1978 (limitation period to challenge tax sale) when the state fails to comply with the notice requirements of this section and federal and state constitutional due process requirements. Hoffman v. State Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1994-NMCA-032, 117 N.M. 263, 871 P.2d 27.  
Due process requirements. — Due process requires that the state must provide notice of sale to parties whose interest in property would be affected by a tax sale, as long as that information is reasonably ascertainable. Brown v. Greig, 1987-NMCA-096, 106 N.M. 202, 740 P.2d 1186, cert. denied, 106 N.M. 174, 740 P.2d 1158.  
Persons to whom notice is necessary. — In keeping with the intent of the legislature to notify "each property owner" of an impending sale of his property, it is implicit that the legislature also intended that holders of record title be notified of the same thing. Brown v. Greig, 1987-NMCA-096, 106 N.M. 202, 740 P.2d 1186, cert. denied, 106 N.M. 174, 740 P.2d 1158.  
Indications of ownership. — When the record owner of three lots orally notified the county assessor that he no longer owned the lots and would not be responsible for the property taxes, that notice did not constitute a waiver of his right to be notified of the subsequent delinquency prior to the tax sales, where the purchaser never recorded his deeds, record owner repurchased the properties, and no documentation, other than the grant of an easement, appeared of record which would have indicated purchaser's interest in the property. Brown v. Greig, 1987-NMCA-096, 106 N.M. 202, 740 P.2d 1186, cert. denied, 106 N.M. 174, 740 P.2d 1158.  
Notice requirements in effect at time of sale apply. — A tax sale is controlled by the notice requirements in effect at the time of the sale, not by those in effect when the tax lien arose. Buescher v. Jaquez, 1983-NMSC-107, 101 N.M. 2, 677 P.2d 615.  
Reasonable diligence to locate taxpayer contact information. — Where the state failed to contact the utility company that served the nonresident taxpayer’s rural property, to red tag the taxpayer’s property with a warning of the tax deficiency, and to 
access public records in the state where the taxpayer was known to reside; accessed only two internet websites that contained published telephone and address information when the state knew that the contact information listed under the taxpayer’s name was unpublished; and although the taxpayer was a prominent businessman and property owner in his home state, failed to use internet websites that would produce information about the taxpayer, the state was not reasonably diligent in attempting to locate the reasonably ascertainable contact information of the deficient taxpayer before selling his property at auction in violation of due process. Gates v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dept., 2008-NMCA-023, 143 N.M. 446, 176 P.3d 1178.  
Duty to seek correct address. — Subsection A requires the division (department) to send notice to delinquent taxpayers via certified mail, return receipt requested. This requirement implicitly requires the division (department) to send the notice to the correct address. The division (department) has an affirmative duty to seek out, by "diligent search and inquiry", the correct address of each property owner, and failure to do so may violate due process. Patrick v. Rice, 1991-NMCA-063, 112 N.M. 285, 814 P.2d 463, cert. denied, 112 N.M. 308, 815 P.2d 161.  
Incorrect address does not invalidate sale. — The return of a notice of tax sale to the department indicating an incorrect address did not invalidate the tax sale. Cano v. Lovato, 1986-NMCA-043, 105 N.M. 522, 734 P.2d 762, cert. quashed, 105 N.M. 438, 733 P.2d 1321 (1987).  
Incorrect address immaterial if notice received. — The incorrect address on the envelope is immaterial if the notice actually got to the right address. The statute does not turn on the technical accuracy of the address typed on the envelope, which is merely a delivery vehicle, but upon mailing the notice "to the address" shown on the latest tax schedule. Wine v. Neal, 1983-NMSC-087, 100 N.M. 431, 671 P.2d 1142.  
Incorrect address immaterial if no challenge on those grounds. — There is no basis for voiding a tax sale merely because the proper address was not correctly printed on the notice envelope, where there is no challenge as to whether the notice actually reached the correct address. Wine v. Neal, 1983-NMSC-087, 100 N.M. 431, 671 P.2d 1142.  
Intent of 1990 amendment to Subsection D. — Subsection D of this section, as amended in 1990, was intended to legislatively overrule the Supreme Court's decision in State ex rel. Klineline v. Blackhurst, 1988-NMSC-015, 106 N.M. 732, 749 P.2d 1111. Cordova v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't., 2005-NMCA-009, 136 N.M. 713, 104 P.3d 1104.  
Receipt of notice of return receipt shall be deemed adequate notice as long as the notice of the tax sale was mailed in compliance with Subsection A of this section. Cordova v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't., 2005-NMCA-009, 136 N.M. 713, 104 P.3d 1104.  
Failure to notify rendering sale invalid. — Tax sale was invalid since the owner had sent the county a change of address and the division's attempt to notify the owner of delinquent taxes and of the tax sale failed, due primarily to the county treasurer's initial failure to properly record the owner's new address. Chavez v. Sharvelle, 1988-NMCA-005, 106 N.M. 793, 750 P.2d 1119, cert. denied, 107 N.M. 16, 751 P.2d 700.  
A tax sale may be invalidated and rescheduled if not conducted substantially in accordance with the tax code so long as the deed has not yet been issued and delivered to the purchaser. — Where, after a three-year period of nonpayment of delinquent property taxes by the owner of a ten-acre parcel of land located in Santa Fe county, the taxation and revenue department (department) placed the property up for sale at public auction, and where the department complied with the notice requirements of 7-38-66 and 7-38-67(B) NMSA 1978, but on the day before the auction, a department employee mistakenly notified the department personnel charged with preparing the next day's auction that the taxes on the parcel at issue had been paid and that the parcel should be removed from the list of properties for sale, and where, on the day of the auction, certain potential bidders left the auction after they were notified that the property would not be sold that day, and where the parcel was placed on a list of properties removed from the auction for a short period of time, but was returned to the auction list after the county treasurer's office informed the department that payment of delinquent taxes had not been made, and where the property was then sold to purchaser, the sole bidder, for the minimum price of $17,100, the amount of taxes, penalty, interest and costs owed to the state, and where, two days after the tax sale, the department invalidated the tax sale for not substantially complying with the requirements of the tax code after learning from a potential bidder that she had left the auction in reliance on the department's announcement and subsequent assurances that the parcel would not be sold on the day of the auction, and where purchaser filed a petition for writ of mandamus in district court, asking the court to order the department to issue a tax deed for the parcel, the district erred in entering a peremptory writ of mandamus ordering the department to issue a tax deed, because the parcel was not sold substantially in compliance with the public auction requirement of the tax code when the property was sold without recognizing the property owner's interest and right to receive any amount generated at public auction in excess of the debt to the state, and by announcing at the outset of the auction that the parcel would not be sold that day, the department essentially negated the prior notice to potential purchasers required by 7-38-67(B) NMSA 1978 and undermined the legislature's purpose in requiring a public auction to increase the sale price.  Dearborn v. Clarke, 2024-NMCA-002.  
Validity of sale not affected by failure to deliver notice. — Since party did not receive the notices required by former 72-8-30, 1953 Comp., to be mailed to him by the tax commission at least 30 days (now 20) prior to the actual sale, if such notice was mailed, it was specifically provided in that section that the fact that the notice was not delivered to the addressee would not affect the validity of any subsequent sale. Bailey v. Barranca, 1971-NMSC-074, 83 N.M. 90, 488 P.2d 725.  
Effect of failure of notice. — A tax sale will not be invalidated under the curative act for failure to give, or of the taxpayer to receive, notice of taxes due or that redemption time is about to expire. Bailey v. Barranca, 1971-NMSC-074, 83 N.M. 90, 488 P.2d 725; Worman v. Echo Ridge Homes Coop., 1982-NMSC-081, 98 N.M. 237, 647 P.2d 870.  
Failure to give notice does not constitute constructive fraud. — Failure to give notice of a tax sale of land or the failure of taxpayer to receive such notice, standing alone, does not constitute constructive fraud invalidating the tax sale. Lamb v. Manley, 1954-NMSC-046, 58 N.M. 292, 270 P.2d 706; Worman v. Echo Ridge Homes Coop., 1982-NMSC-081, 98 N.M. 237, 647 P.2d 870.  
The failure to send notice of a delinquent tax sale to the record owner, and to red tag the land, does not amount to constructive fraud. Worman v. Echo Ridge Homes Coop., 1982-NMSC-081, 98 N.M. 237, 647 P.2d 870.

7-38-67. Real property sale requirements. 
A. Real property shall not be sold for delinquent taxes before the expiration of three years from the first date shown on the tax delinquency list on which the taxes on the real property became delinquent.  
B. Notice of the sale shall be published in a local newspaper within the county where the real property is located or, if there is no local county or municipal newspaper, then a newspaper published in a county contiguous to or near the county in which the real property is located, at least once a week for the three weeks immediately preceding the week of the sale. For more generalized notice, the department may choose to publish notice of the sale also in a newspaper not published within the county and of more general circulation. The notice shall state the time and place of the sale and shall include a description of the real property sufficient to permit its identification and location by potential purchasers.  
C. Real property shall be sold at public auction either by the department or an auctioneer hired by the department. The auction shall be held in the county where the real property is located at a time and place designated by the department.  
D. If the real property can be divided so as to enable the department to sell only part of it and pay all delinquent taxes, penalties, interest and costs, the department may, with the consent of the owner, sell only a part of the real property.  
E. Before the sale, the department shall determine a minimum sale price for the real property. In determining the minimum price, the department shall consider the value of the property owner's interest in the real property, the amount of all delinquent taxes, penalties and interest for which it is being sold and the costs. The minimum price shall not be less than the total of all delinquent taxes, penalties, interest and costs. Real property shall not be sold for less than the minimum price unless no offer met the minimum price when it was offered at an earlier public auction or the property is sold in accordance with the provisions of Subsection H of this section. A sale properly made under the authority of and in accordance with the requirements of this section constitutes full payment of all delinquent taxes, penalties and interest that are a lien against the property at the time of sale, and the sale extinguishes the lien.  
F. Payment shall be made in full by the close of the public auction before an offer may be deemed accepted by the department.  
G. Real property not offered for sale may be offered for sale at a later sale, but the requirements of this section and Section 7-38-66 NMSA 1978 shall be met in connection with each sale.  
H. The board of trustees of a community land grant-merced governed pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 49, Article 1 NMSA 1978 or by statutes specific to the named land grant-merced shall be allowed to match the highest bid at a public auction, which shall entitle the board of trustees to purchase the property for the amount bid if:  
(1) the property is situated within the boundaries of that land grant-merced as shown in the United States patent to the grant;  
(2) the bid covers all past taxes, penalties, interest and costs due on the property; and  
(3) the land becomes part of the common lands of the land grant-merced.  
History: 1953 Comp., § 72-31-67, enacted by Laws 1973, ch. 258, § 107; 1974, ch. 92, § 24; 1982, ch. 28, § 24; 1983, ch. 215, § 5; 1995, ch. 12, § 12; 2001, ch. 253, § 3; 2001, ch. 254, § 3; 2005, ch. 211, § 1.  
ANNOTATIONS 
Cross references. — For laws relating to land grant-merced, see 49-1-1 to 49-1-22 NMSA 1978.  
The 2005 amendment, effective July 1, 2005, in Subsection E, provided that real property shall not be sold for less than the minimum price unless no offer met the minimum price when the property is sold in accordance with Subsection H and added Subsection H to provide that the board of trustees shall be allowed to match the highest bid at a public auction and purchase the property for the amount bid if the property is within a land grant-merced, the bid covers all past taxes, penalties, interest and costs and the land becomes part of the common lands of the land grant-merced.  
The 2001 amendment, effective June 15, 2001, in Subsection B, substituted "local newspaper" for "newspaper of general circulation", added "or, if there is no local county or municipal newspaper, then a newspaper published in a county contiguous to or near the county in which the real property is located", and added the second sentence.  
The 1995 amendment, effective June 16, 1995, substituted "department" for "division" throughout the section and substituted "costs" for "expenses of the sale" in Subsection D and in two places in Subsection E.  
Notice by publication inadequate for mortgagee. — Notice by publication, in compliance with this section, does not provide a mortgagee of real property with constitutionally adequate notice of a proceeding to sell the mortgaged property for nonpayment of taxes. Macaron v. Assocs. Capital Servs. Corp., 1987-NMCA-005, 105 N.M. 380, 733 P.2d 11.  
Owner's interest. — Subsection E of this section requires the department to "consider" both the owner's interest and the amount of delinquent taxes, penalties, and costs, but then the department is directed to set the minimum price as not less than the total of the delinquent taxes, penalties, and costs. Thus, the legislature does not appear to have required any definite amount representing the owner's interest as part of the minimum sale price. Cochrell v. Mitchell, 2003-NMCA-094, 134 N.M. 180, 75 P.3d 396.  
A tax sale may be invalidated and rescheduled if not conducted substantially in accordance with the tax code so long as the deed has not yet been issued and delivered to the purchaser. — Where, after a three-year period of nonpayment of delinquent property taxes by the owner of a ten-acre parcel of land located in Santa Fe county, the taxation and revenue department (department) placed the property up for sale at public auction, and where the department complied with the notice requirements of 7-38-66 and 7-38-67(B) NMSA 1978, but on the day before the auction, a department employee mistakenly notified the department personnel charged with preparing the next day's auction that the taxes on the parcel at issue had been paid and that the parcel should be removed from the list of properties for sale, and where, on the day of the auction, certain potential bidders left the auction after they were notified that the property would not be sold that day, and where the parcel was placed on a list of properties removed from the auction for a short period of time, but was returned to the 
auction list after the county treasurer's office informed the department that payment of delinquent taxes had not been made, and where the property was then sold to purchaser, the sole bidder, for the minimum price of $17,100, the amount of taxes, penalty, interest and costs owed to the state, and where, two days after the tax sale, the department invalidated the tax sale for not substantially complying with the requirements of the tax code after learning from a potential bidder that she had left the auction in reliance on the department's announcement and subsequent assurances that the parcel would not be sold on the day of the auction, and where purchaser filed a petition for writ of mandamus in district court, asking the court to order the department to issue a tax deed for the parcel, the district erred in entering a peremptory writ of mandamus ordering the department to issue a tax deed, because the parcel was not sold substantially in compliance with the public auction requirement of the tax code when the property was sold without recognizing the property owner's interest and right to receive any amount generated at public auction in excess of the debt to the state, and by announcing at the outset of the auction that the parcel would not be sold that day, the department essentially negated the prior notice to potential purchasers required by 7-38-67(B) NMSA 1978 and undermined the legislature's purpose in requiring a public auction to increase the sale price.  Dearborn v. Clarke, 2024-NMCA-002. 
The department is not required to execute and deliver a deed if the property was not sold in substantial compliance with the tax code. — Where, after a three-year period of nonpayment of delinquent property taxes by the owner of a ten-acre parcel of land located in Santa Fe county, the taxation and revenue department (department) placed the property up for sale at public auction, and where the property was sold to purchaser, the sole bidder, for the minimum price of $17,100, the amount of taxes, penalty, interest and costs owed to the state, and where, two days after the tax sale, the department invalidated the tax sale for not substantially complying with the requirements of the tax code after learning from a potential bidder that she had left the auction in reliance on the department's announcement and subsequent assurances that the parcel would not be sold that day, and where purchaser filed a petition for writ of mandamus in district court, asking the court to order the department to issue a tax deed for the parcel, and where the district court entered a peremptory writ of mandamus ordering the department to issue a tax deed for the parcel of land, finding that even assuming the sale was not conducted substantially in accordance with the tax code, the department had a mandatory duty under the plain language of 7-38-70(A) NMSA 1978 to issue and deliver a tax deed to petitioner upon receiving payment for the property and that the department lacked the authority to invalidate the sale once payment was received, the district court erred in entering a peremptory writ of mandamus, because the legislature intended that the department's authority to invalidate a substantially flawed tax sale to continue until the department has reviewed the conduct of the sale and determined that a valid tax deed can be issued.

7-38-67.1. Sale of abandoned real property; notice of sale; requirements. 
A. Abandoned real property may be sold by special sale.  
B. Notice of the sale shall be published in a local newspaper within the county where the abandoned real property is located, or in a newspaper published in a county contiguous to or near the county in which the abandoned real property is located, the week immediately preceding the week of the sale. In cases where abandoned real property is offered for sale via an online platform pursuant to Subsection D of this section, the notice of the sale shall be published in a local newspaper within the county where the abandoned real property is located, or in a newspaper published in a county contiguous to or near the county in which the abandoned real property is located, the week immediately preceding the week of the beginning of the continuous online sale. Online sales notices pursuant to this section shall also be published on the property tax division's website. The notice shall:  
(1) state the time and place of the sale;  
(2) if the sale is made via an online sale pursuant to Subsection D of this section, state the date and time the sale will begin and expire and the property tax division's website where the property being sold will be listed;  
(3) include the name of the subdivision in which the abandoned real property is located;  
(4) state the total minimum bid; and  
(5) provide the phone number of the property tax division and the web address where interested buyers may obtain copies of the list of properties to be sold.  
C. Abandoned real property may be sold at public auction either by the department or an auctioneer hired by the department. The auction shall be held in the county where the abandoned real property is located at a time and place designated by the department.  
D. Abandoned real property may be offered for sale via an online platform on the property tax division's website, and notice shall be given pursuant to Subsection B of this section. The sales of abandoned real property listed on the property tax division's website may be continuous until December 31 of the tax year in which the abandoned real property is offered for sale. For subsequent tax years, notice shall be given pursuant to Subsection B of this section before the abandoned real property listed on the property tax division's website can be reoffered for sale.  
E. Before the sale, the department shall determine a minimum sale price for the abandoned real property. In determining the minimum price, the department shall consider the amount of all delinquent taxes, penalties, interest and costs for which the abandoned real property is being sold. If the department determines the total amount due is in excess of the sale price that could reasonably be made through public auction, the property tax division may offer the abandoned real property for less than the total amount of delinquent taxes, penalties, interest and costs due.  
F. A sale properly made under the authority of and in accordance with the requirements of this section constitutes full payment of all delinquent taxes, penalties and interest that are a lien pursuant to Section 7-38-48 NMSA 1978 against the abandoned real property at the time of sale, and the sale extinguishes the lien.  
G. Payment shall be made in full by the close of the public auction before an offer may be deemed accepted by the department. For abandoned real property sold via an online platform pursuant to Subsection D of this section, payment shall be made in full within one business day of the bid being accepted by the department before an offer may be deemed accepted by the department. Receipt of a bid from a buyer by the department is not acceptance of the bid by the department. The department shall notify the buyer whose bid is accepted by the department, and the one business day payment requirement begins at the time the buyer received notice of acceptance to the buyer whose bid was accepted by the department. Notice of acceptance of a bid sent to a buyer by the department may be sent via email. Failure of a buyer whose bid was accepted by the department and to whom notice was sent by the department to pay the full sales price within one business day invalidates the sale and the property can be reoffered for sale unless the buyer receives an extension to make payment from the department. Requests for time extensions and approvals of time extensions can be made via email.  
H. The board of trustees of a community land grant-merced governed pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 49, Article 1 NMSA 1978, or by statutes specific to the named land grant-merced, shall be allowed to exercise the right of first offer to purchase the abandoned real property if:  
(1) the abandoned real property offered for sale is situated within the boundaries of that land grant-merced as shown in the United States patent to the grant;  
(2) the offer covers all taxes, penalties, interest and costs due on the abandoned real property unless the minimum sales price is reduced below total amounts owed pursuant to Subsection E of this section; and  
(3) the land becomes part of the common lands of the land grant-merced.  
I. In the event that there is a competing interest in the abandoned real property by prior landholders, such as land grant owners, pueblos or nontaxable entities, the secretary shall determine who has the prevailing right of first offer.  
J. The time requirements of this section are subject to the provisions of Section 7-38-83 NMSA 1978.  
K. As used in this section, "right of first offer" means the department is obliged to undergo exclusive good faith negotiations with the rights holder before offering abandoned real property for sale to the public.

Effective dates. — Laws 2018, ch. 50 contained no effective date provision, but, pursuant to N.M. Const., art. IV, § 23, was effective May 16, 2018, 90 days after the adjournment of the legislature.  
7-38-68. Installment agreements. 
A. The division may enter into an installment agreement for the payment of all delinquent property taxes, penalties, interest and costs due with respect to either real property or a manufactured home with the owner of the real property or manufactured home whose taxes have become delinquent and whose account for all or part of the delinquent taxes has been transferred for collection to the division. Execution of an installment agreement under this section by a property owner is an irrevocable admission of liability for all taxes that are the subject of the agreement. The installment agreement shall be in writing and shall not extend for a period of more than thirty-six months. Interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance during the period of the installment agreement. The rate of interest shall be one percent a month, and no other interest on that portion of the principal representing unpaid taxes shall accrue while an installment agreement is in effect. The division shall not enter into an installment agreement with a property owner on or after the date of the initial sale of real property or manufactured home for delinquent taxes whether or not the real property or manufactured home is sold and a deed issued as a result of that sale. The division shall promulgate regulations establishing requirements for a minimum down payment and substantially equal monthly payments for installment agreements.  
B. An installment agreement prevents any further action to collect the delinquent taxes stated in the agreement as long as the terms of the agreement are met.  
C. The division may proceed under the Property Tax Code to collect the property taxes, penalties, interest and costs due and unpaid if:  
(1) installment payments are not made on or before the dates specified in the agreement;  
(2) the property owner fails to pay other property taxes when required; or  
(3) any other condition contained in the agreement is not met.  
D. For the purpose of computing the time when real property or a manufactured home may be sold for delinquent taxes, the date of original delinquency shall be used when the delinquent taxes have been the subject of an installment agreement that was subsequently breached by the property owner.  
E. If an owner of real property or a manufactured home enters into an installment agreement and subsequently breaches the agreement under this section, the division shall not enter into another installment agreement with that property owner for the payment of the delinquent taxes that were the subject of the installment agreement.  
F. Alphabetically indexed and serially numbered records of installment agreements must be kept in the office of the director and made available for public inspection.

Amounts collected under installment agreements entered into by the department that represent delinquent taxes shall be remitted to the county treasurer of the county to which the net taxable value of the property is allocated for distribution to the governmental units. Amounts collected that represent penalties, interest and costs shall be retained by the department in accordance with Section 7-38-71 NMSA 1978. Money collected shall be remitted at the times and in the manner required by regulations of the department of finance and administration. When the department has received payment in full of delinquent taxes, penalties, interest and costs paid under an installment agreement, the department shall notify the county treasurer of that fact, and the county treasurer shall make an entry on the property tax schedule indicating that the delinquent property taxes, penalties and interest have been paid.

The 1990 amendment, effective May 16, 1990, substituted "department" for "division" in the first sentence, rewrote the second sentence which read "Amounts collected that represent penalties and interests shall be remitted to the appropriate county treasurer for deposit in the county general fund" and, in the final sentence, substituted "department has received" for "county treasurer has received" and "the department shall notify the county treasurer of that fact and the county treasurer shall make an entry" for "he shall make an entry".  
7-38-70. Issuance of deeds as result of sale of real property for delinquent taxes; effect of deeds; limitation of action to challenge conveyance. 
A. Upon receiving payment for real property sold for delinquent taxes, the division shall execute and deliver a deed to the purchaser.  
B. If the real property was sold substantially in accordance with the Property Tax Code, the deed conveys all of the former property owner's interest in the real property as of the date the state's lien for real property taxes arose in accordance with the Property Tax Code, subject only to perfected interests in the real property existing before the date the property tax lien arose.  
C. After two years from the date of sale, neither the former real property owner shown on the property tax schedule as the delinquent taxpayer nor anyone claiming through him may bring an action challenging the conveyance.  
D. Subject to the limitation of Subsection C of this section, in all controversies and suits involving title to real property held under a deed from the state issued under this section, any person claiming title adverse to that acquired by the deed from the state must prove, in order to defeat the title, that:  
(1) the real property was not subject to taxation for the tax years for which the delinquent taxes for which it was sold were imposed;  
(2) the division failed to mail the notice required under Section 7-38-66 NMSA 1978 or to receive any required return receipt;  
(3) he, or the person through whom he claims, had title to the real property at the time of the sale and had paid all delinquent taxes, penalties, interest and costs prior to the sale as provided in Subsection E of Section 7-38-66 NMSA 1978; or  
(4) he, or the person through whom he claims, had entered into an installment agreement to pay all delinquent taxes, penalties, interest and costs prior to the sale as provided in Section 7-38-68 NMSA 1978 and that all payments due were made timely.

ANNOTATIONS 
I. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. 
Suing to quiet title within two years of tax sale. — Section 42-6-1 NMSA 1978, which provides that "Title may be quieted against the owner or holder of any mortgage, claim of lien or other encumbrance, where the owner or holder of such mortgage, lien or encumbrance has permitted [the encumbrance] to become barred by the statute of limitations," does not bar a plaintiff from initiating a suit to quiet title to clear a cloud against the title within the two-year period following a tax sale, provided in Subsection D of this section. Bentz v. Peterson, 1988-NMCA-071, 107 N.M. 597, 762 P.2d 259.  
Time of delivery of deed. — This section does not mandate immediate delivery of the deed at the time of sale; thus, a deed delivered one month after the tax sale was issued pursuant to statutory authority, and the sale and deed could not be invalidated on the basis of a claimed jurisdictional defect. Cano v. Lovato, 1986-NMCA-043, 105 N.M. 522, 734 P.2d 762, cert. quashed, 105 N.M. 438, 733 P.2d 1321.  
Applicability of recording act. — Section 14-9-3 NMSA 1978, relating to effect of unrecorded instruments applies to tax deeds. Cano v. Lovato, 1986-NMCA-043, 105 N.M. 522, 734 P.2d 762, cert. quashed, 105 N.M. 438, 733 P.2d 1321.  
Grantees in quitclaim deed from purchaser of property sold for taxes would take subject to all defects therein of which they knew, or which an examination of the record would disclose. State ex rel. State Tax Comm'n v. Garcia, 1967-NMSC-098, 77 N.M. 703, 427 P.2d 230.  
Purpose of statutes on tax deeds is to give a measure of certainty and security to tax titles. First Nat'l Bank v. State, 1967-NMSC-097, 77 N.M. 695, 427 P.2d 225.  
Original owner's right to purchase. — Former statutory language gave the original owner of the land the preferential right to purchase the property upon the payment of the full amount of taxes, penalties, interest and costs for which the property was sold by the tax sale proceedings. The purpose of the legislature was to grant a preference to the original property owner to become reinvested of his property upon payment of taxes, penalties, interest and costs. Trujillo v. Montano, 1958-NMSC-079, 64 N.M. 259, 327 P.2d 326 (decided under prior law).  
Power of treasurer (department) to execute tax deed is not exhausted until a deed is made in compliance with law. Brown v. Gurley, 1954-NMSC-025, 58 N.M. 153, 267 P.2d 134.  
The assessment of property for taxation is one of the essential steps leading up to a sale for taxes. If an assessment is void, it follows inevitably that the sale based upon such assessment is likewise void. Baltzley v. Lujan, 1949-NMSC-065, 53 N.M. 502, 212 P.2d 417.  
II. CHALLENGES TO TAX SALE. 
A. GENERALLY. 
Grounds for challenge to tax sale are generally strictly limited to the grounds set forth in Subsection D of this section, but there could be such a degree of noncompliance with other required procedures that a tax sale could be voided on grounds other than those of that subsection. Cochrell v. Mitchell, 2003-NMCA-094, 134 N.M. 180, 75 P.3d 396.  
Substantial compliance. — Subsection B means that a trial court is empowered to review the sale procedures, but not for the purpose of requiring letter-perfect compliance with each requirement of the statutes. Cochrell v. Mitchell, 2003-NMCA-094, 134 N.M. 180, 75 P.3d 396.  
A reading of the entirety of this section, together with the cases, indicates that the substantial compliance language of Subsection B of this section must overlay all the other statutes that comprise the Property Tax Code. Cochrell v. Mitchell, 2003-NMCA-094, 134 N.M. 180, 75 P.3d 396.  
This section is "curative" statute that stringently limits the grounds upon which a successful attack upon a tax deed issued by the state may be made. It also limits the time for bringing such action. Bailey v. Barranca, 1971-NMSC-074, 83 N.M. 90, 488 P.2d 725.  
Tax deed prima facie valid. — Since tax deeds attacked were signed by the proper officials, they were prima facie valid unless some departure from statutory mandates, which made the conveyance a nullity and void, was established. The burden in this respect was on the state in order to overcome the prima facie effect granted the deeds by former 72-8-43, 1953 Comp. First Nat'l Bank v. State, 1967-NMSC-097, 77 N.M. 695, 427 P.2d 225.  
Tax titles subject to attack for failure of procedure. — While the title received from the state is a new and paramount title in fee simple absolute, tax titles are commonly subject to attack for failure to comply with statutory procedures in the assessment and collection of taxes, in the sale of properties because of failure to pay taxes and in the redemption from tax sale. State ex rel. State Tax Comm'n v. Garcia, 1967-NMSC-098, 77 N.M. 703, 427 P.2d 230.  
B. STANDING. 
Appellants without color of title have no standing to contest deed. — Since appellants could show no color of title, they did not have title to the land at the time of the sale and were not the owners of the land sold for taxes and, therefore, could not claim fraud nor contest appellee's tax deed under provisions of former version of this section. Griego v. Roybal, 1970-NMSC-021, 81 N.M. 202, 465 P.2d 85.  
Mere possession of land is not such substantial right as would constitute "title" required by this section. Griego v. Roybal, 1970-NMSC-021, 81 N.M. 202, 465 P.2d 85.  
State in no better position than other stranger. — The state is in no better position to avoid its deeds or to claim deprivation of rights guaranteed by statute to the prior owner than would be some other stranger to the right. First Nat'l Bank v. State, 1967-NMSC-097, 77 N.M. 695, 427 P.2d 225.  
State has no standing to assert rights of owners. — The rights preserved in the statutes are rights of "owners" as that term is interpreted, and the state cannot bring itself within the protection of those statutes. Unless the conveyances were void and a nullity, the state has no standing to assert rights given by statute to "owners" or "persons entitled to redeem." First Nat'l Bank v. State, 1967-NMSC-097, 77 N.M. 695, 427 P.2d 225.  
C. PARTICULAR GROUNDS. 
Fraud as grounds for challenge of tax deed. — Prior to 1973, constructive fraud by the officer selling property was a statutory ground for attacking a tax deed but in 1973, the legislature amended the Property Tax Code, omitting fraud by tax officials from the list of statutory grounds for attacking a tax deed. Cordova v. N.M. Taxation & Revenue Dep't., 2005-NMCA-009, 136 N.M. 713, 104 P.3d 1104.  
Fraud by county treasurer avoids tax title. — Fraud on the part of the county treasurer, either actual or constructive, will suffice to avoid a tax title and save property from forfeiture. Trujillo v. Dimas, 1956-NMSC-043, 61 N.M. 235, 297 P.2d 1060.  
Constitutional and statutory notice requirements applicable to Subsection C. — The legislature did not intend to apply Subsection C when the state fails to comply with the notice requirements of Section 7-38-66 NMSA 1978 and federal and state constitutional due process requirements. Hoffman v. State, Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1994-NMCA-032, 117 N.M. 263, 871 P.2d 27.  
Notice of tax sale constitutionally inadequate. — The notice of a tax sale was constitutionally inadequate under both the United States and New Mexico Constitutions, since the notice was mailed only to the taxpayer's old address, the notice was returned with a stamp indicating that the forwarding address had expired, and the new location of the taxpayer was reasonably ascertainable since she had submitted a change of address to the county assessor. Hoffman v. State, Taxation & Revenue Dep't, 1994-NMCA-032, 117 N.M. 263, 871 P.2d 27.  
Clear evidence necessary to set aside tax deed for fraud. — One seeking to set aside a tax title on the ground of fraud, actual or constructive, in giving out erroneous information, has the burden of establishing such fact by clear and convincing evidence, a mere preponderance will not suffice. Trujillo v. Dimas, 1956-NMSC-043, 61 N.M. 235, 297 P.2d 1060; Gallegos v. Quinlan, 1980-NMSC-065, 94 N.M. 405, 611 P.2d 1099.  
Tax deed obtained by fraud may be attacked without regard to statute of limitations. Gallegos v. Quinlan, 1980-NMSC-065, 94 N.M. 405, 611 P.2d 1099.  
Payment of taxes under erroneous assessment good defense to sale. — When the owner of land who in good faith paid taxes under an erroneous assessment, thinking and intending the payment to cover the tax on his land, such payment constituted a good defense against the sale and tax deed based upon a second assessment of the same land with a proper description. Trujillo v. Montano, 1958-NMSC-079, 64 N.M. 259, 327 P.2d 326.  
III. TITLE. 
A. GENERALLY. 
Former vendor's interest transferred. — Under Subsection B, all of the former vendor's interests in the real property were conveyed to the defendants by the tax deed because the vendor is a "former property owner." Thus, the vendor's legal title to the property was conveyed to the defendants because legal title is clearly an interest in real property. Further, the vendor lost its reversionary interest in the property because it lost legal title to the land. Southwest Land Inv., Inc. v. Hubbart, 1993-NMSC-072, 116 N.M. 742, 867 P.2d 412.  
Former vendor's perfected interest does not survive. — The Property Tax Code states that "all of the former property owner's interest in the real property" is conveyed. The legislature did not limit the word "all". The second phrase states that the tax deed is accepted "subject only to perfected interests in the real property." The legislature chose to use the same language in both the first and second clauses. Reading these clauses together and giving them their plain meaning, the vendor's perfected security interest in the property did not survive the conveyance by the tax deed. The vendor was an owner under the code and its perfected security interest was an interest "in the real property." Even though the interest may have been perfected, because the interest was "in the real property" and because the vendor was an owner, the interest was conveyed along with all of the vendor's other interests in the property. Southwest Land Inv., Inc. v. Hubbart, 1993-NMSC-072, 116 N.M. 742, 867 P.2d 412.  
The department is not required to execute and deliver a deed if the property was not sold in substantial compliance with the tax code. — Where, after a three-year period of nonpayment of delinquent property taxes by the owner of a ten-acre parcel of land located in Santa Fe county, the taxation and revenue department (department) placed the property up for sale at public auction, and where the property was sold to purchaser, the sole bidder, for the minimum price of $17,100, the amount of taxes, penalty, interest and costs owed to the state, and where, two days after the tax sale, the department invalidated the tax sale for not substantially complying with the requirements of the tax code after learning from a potential bidder that she had left the auction in reliance on the department's announcement and subsequent assurances that the parcel would not be sold that day, and where purchaser filed a petition for writ of 
mandamus in district court, asking the court to order the department to issue a tax deed for the parcel, and where the district court entered a peremptory writ of mandamus ordering the department to issue a tax deed for the parcel of land, finding that even assuming the sale was not conducted substantially in accordance with the tax code, the department had a mandatory duty under the plain language of 7-38-70(A) NMSA 1978 to issue and deliver a tax deed to petitioner upon receiving payment for the property and that the department lacked the authority to invalidate the sale once payment was received, the district court erred in entering a peremptory writ of mandamus, because the legislature intended that the department's authority to invalidate a substantially flawed tax sale to continue until the department has reviewed the conduct of the sale and determined that a valid tax deed can be issued.  Dearborn v. Clarke, 2024-NMCA-002.  
Effect of multiple tax sale certificates. — Although a tax sale certificate to which the deed in question could be traced was issued at a time when the state already had title pursuant to an earlier certificate and tax deed, the state's conveyance to the property owner was nonetheless valid. Deeds from the state do not purport to convey interests acquired by the state under any particular tax deed, regardless of certain tax sale certificates or deeds that are referenced in the conveyance. A deed from the state is a conveyance of its interest in land, not its interest in a particular tax deed or tax sale certificate. Johnson v. Rodgers, 1991-NMSC-059, 112 N.M. 137, 812 P.2d 791.  
Tax deed subject to subsequent lien under "betterment" statute. — To subject a tax deed to operation of a subsequent lien under the "betterment" statute, Section 42-4-18 NMSA 1978, is not in conflict with Subsection B of this section, governing the issuance and effect of tax deeds - to preclude such a lien would foreclose an avenue of security for those performing services upon the property and allow unjust enrichment. Cano v. Lovato, 1986-NMCA-043, 105 N.M. 522, 734 P.2d 762, cert. quashed, 105 N.M. 438, 733 P.2d 1321.  
Mortgagees cannot extinguish mortgage by tax deed. — When a tax deed grantee is the previous owner of the property, his mortgage is not extinguished. In re Bouma, 32 Bankr., 619 (Bank. D.N.M. 1983).  
Tax deed grants fee simple absolute. — Once land is sold by the state for delinquent taxes, the tax deed issued becomes a new and paramount title in fee simple absolute, striking down all previous titles and interests in the property. This is to ensure certainty and stability in tax titles, and to promote important social and economic objectives such as raising state revenues and promoting land improvement. Worman v. Echo Ridge Homes Coop., 1982-NMSC-081, 98 N.M. 237, 647 P.2d 870.  
Perpetual grazing right extinguished by tax sale. — Alleged perpetual grazing right which arose either by express reservation in the deed or by prescription was extinguished by tax sale by the state. Huning v. Potts, 1977-NMSC-037, 90 N.M. 407, 564 P.2d 612.  
Tax title is in nature of new and independent grant from the sovereign authority and is a new and paramount title in fee simple absolute, striking down all previous titles and interests in the property. Bailey v. Barranca, 1971-NMSC-074, 83 N.M. 90, 488 P.2d 725.  
Fraudulent tax deed passes good title to bona fide purchaser. — A tax deed fraudulently obtained from the state is not void, but simply voidable, and there can be no cancellation when there has been a sale to a bona fide purchaser. State ex rel. State Tax Comm'n v. Garcia, 1967-NMSC-098, 77 N.M. 703, 427 P.2d 230.  
Tenant may buy tax title. — A tenant who owes no duty to pay taxes for his landlord and who has not withheld rents due, or in some other manner lulled his landlord into tax delinquency, may, while in possession of the property, both buy a tax title and assert it. Gore v. Cone, 1955-NMSC-075, 60 N.M. 29, 287 P.2d 229.  
B. PROPERTY DESCRIPTION. 
The test of validity of a tax deed is whether the description is sufficient, aided by data furnished by it, to identify the property. The substitution of "NE" for "NW" resulted in the identification of an entirely different parcel of property than that which was intended to have been assessed. Ambiguity may not be resolved by reference to the description of the property in the assessment rolls of prior and subsequent years. Brylinski v. Cooper, 1981-NMSC-028, 95 N.M. 580, 624 P.2d 522.  
Property conveyed. — Lands underlying a dam and reservior and which are budgeted with severed easements for the maintenance and operation of the dam, were not covered by an assessment describing the estate as improvements. The lands were not sold for delinquent taxes and the tax deed, upon which plaintiff based its title, does not cover them. Rio Costilla Coop. Livestock Ass'n v. W.S. Ranch Co., 1970-NMSC-020, 81 N.M. 353, 467 P.2d 19.  
The rules regarding sufficiency of descriptions in deeds are applicable to tax deeds. Hughes v. Meem, 1962-NMSC-039, 70 N.M. 122, 371 P.2d 235.  
Sale not affected by error in survey number. — When the tax deed issued to the plaintiff described the land as being located in homestead entry survey 370, instead of 378, the error was so manifestly clerical that the validity of the sale could not be affected by it. Trujillo v. Montano, 1958-NMSC-079, 64 N.M. 259, 327 P.2d 326.  
IV. REDEMPTION. 
Tax deed issued before period of redemption has expired is void. First Nat'l Bank v. State, 1967-NMSC-097, 77 N.M. 695, 427 P.2d 225.  
Contention plaintiff prevented right of redemption unfounded. — Plaintiff's contention that he was prevented from exercising his right of redemption on property 
sold to state for delinquent taxes by fraud of county tax assessor is unfounded where fraud is based on assessor's refusal to alter the description on tax rolls in the absence of a court order. Trujillo v. Dimas, 1956-NMSC-043, 61 N.M. 235, 297 P.2d 1060.  
Adverse possession protected by redemption. — The right to acquire title by adverse possession is capable of protection by means of redemption from a tax sale. Morris v. Ross, 1954-NMSC-063, 58 N.M. 379, 271 P.2d 823.  
Effect of redemption will not be a transfer of the inchoate title of the purchaser at tax sale but will be to extinguish the tax sale; and, as to all other persons who might have had a right to redeem, the redemption is in their interest and, consequently, they are not adversely affected. Morris v. Ross, 1954-NMSC-063, 58 N.M. 379, 271 P.2d 823.  
Failure of notice to redeem. — The failure of the treasurer to send notice that the property had been sold for taxes and of the tax commission to advise of the sale and of the preferential right of redemption or repurchase were at most irregularities which were covered by the curative provisions of this article. Brown v. Gurley, 1954-NMSC-025, 58 N.M. 153, 267 P.2d 134 (decided under prior law).  
Am. Jur. 2d, A.L.R. and C.J.S. references. — Easement, servitude, or covenant as affected by sale for taxes, 7 A.L.R.5th 187.  
7-38-71. Distribution of amounts received from sale of property. 
A. Money received by the department from the sale of real or personal property for delinquent property taxes shall be deposited in a suspense fund and distributed as follows:  
(1) first, that portion equal to the costs shall be retained by the department for use, subject to appropriation by the legislature, in administration of the Property Tax Code;  
(2) second, that portion equal to the penalties and interest due shall be retained by the department for use, subject to appropriation by the legislature, by the department in administration of the Property Tax Code;  
(3) third, that portion equal to the delinquent taxes due shall be remitted by the department to the appropriate county treasurer for distribution by the treasurer to the governmental units in accordance with the law and the regulations of the department of finance and administration; and  
(4) the balance shall be paid to the former owner of the property sold or to any other person designated by order directed to the department by a court of competent jurisdiction, provided that the department may first apply all or any portion of the balance to be paid against the amount of any property tax, including any penalty 
and interest related thereto, owed by the person to whom the balance would otherwise be paid.  
B. As a condition precedent to payment of the balance of the sale amount received to the former owner of the property, the department may require any person claiming to be entitled to that payment to present sufficient evidence of proof of former ownership of the property to the department. The department shall adopt regulations providing for the procedures to be followed by persons claiming sale proceeds as former owners in those instances where conflicting claims exist or the department requires proof of ownership.  
C. If no person claims the balance of sale proceeds, whether the property was sold under the provisions of the Property Tax Code or prior law, as the former owner of the property within two years of the date of the sale and after a reasonable search to determine the former owner is made by the department and no former owner is found, the balance of the sale proceeds shall be considered abandoned property and deposited in accordance with the provisions of the Uniform Unclaimed Property Act [Chapter 7, Article 8A NMSA 1978].  
D. If the balance of proceeds from the sale after paying a higher priority claim under Subsection A of this section is insufficient to pay all of the next priority claim, then the complete balance shall be applied to that next priority claim as partial payment.

ANNOTATIONS 
The 1995 amendment, effective June 16, 1995, rewrote Paragraph A(1) which read "first, that portion equal to the expenses of seizure and sale shall be retained by the department and these amounts are appropriated to the department for use in administration of the Property Tax Code" and made stylistic changes in Paragraph A(2).  
The 1990 amendment, effective May 16, 1990, in Subsection A, rewrote Paragraph (2) which read "second, that portion equal to the penalties and interests due shall be remitted by the department, to the appropriate county treasurer for deposit in the county general fund" and added the proviso at the end of Paragraph (4) and, in Subsection C, substituted "Uniform Unclaimed Property Act" for "Uniform Disposition of Unclaimed Property Act".  
A tax sale may be invalidated and rescheduled if not conducted substantially in accordance with the tax code so long as the deed has not yet been issued and delivered to the purchaser. — Where, after a three-year period of nonpayment of delinquent property taxes by the owner of a ten-acre parcel of land located in Santa Fe county, the taxation and revenue department (department) placed the property up for sale at public auction, and where the department complied with the notice requirements of 7-38-66 and 7-38-67(B) NMSA 1978, but on the day before the auction, a department 
employee mistakenly notified the department personnel charged with preparing the next day's auction that the taxes on the parcel at issue had been paid and that the parcel should be removed from the list of properties for sale, and where, on the day of the auction, certain potential bidders left the auction after they were notified that the property would not be sold that day, and where the parcel was placed on a list of properties removed from the auction for a short period of time, but was returned to the auction list after the county treasurer's office informed the department that payment of delinquent taxes had not been made, and where the property was then sold to purchaser, the sole bidder, for the minimum price of $17,100, the amount of taxes, penalty, interest and costs owed to the state, and where, two days after the tax sale, the department invalidated the tax sale for not substantially complying with the requirements of the tax code after learning from a potential bidder that she had left the auction in reliance on the department's announcement and subsequent assurances that the parcel would not be sold on the day of the auction, and where purchaser filed a petition for writ of mandamus in district court, asking the court to order the department to issue a tax deed for the parcel, the district erred in entering a peremptory writ of mandamus ordering the department to issue a tax deed, because the parcel was not sold substantially in compliance with the public auction requirement of the tax code when the property was sold without recognizing the property owner's interest and right to receive any amount generated at public auction in excess of the debt to the state, and by announcing at the outset of the auction that the parcel would not be sold that day, the department essentially negated the prior notice to potential purchasers required by 7-38-67(B) NMSA 1978 and undermined the legislature's purpose in requiring a public auction to increase the sale price.

7-38-72. Notation on property tax schedule by county treasurer when property sold for delinquent taxes. 
When the county treasurer receives written notification from the division of the sale of property for delinquent taxes, he shall make an entry on the property tax schedule indicating that the delinquent property taxes, penalties and interest are no longer a lien against the property.

The department of finance and administration may provide in these regulations for the withholding of amounts of taxes to which the state is entitled to distribution in those 
instances when delinquent property taxes are paid to the department, but the regulations shall require that withheld taxes must be credited and shown as paid by the county treasurer on the property tax schedule.

Duty of department. — The division (department) has an affirmative duty to seek out, by "diligent search and inquiry", the correct address of each property owner, and failure to do so may violate due process. Patrick v. Rice, 1991-NMCA-063, 112 N.M. 285, 814 P.2d 463, cert. denied, 112 N.M. 308, 815 P.2d 161.  
Failure to notify of tax sale. — Since county tax officials and the property tax division were placed on notice that notices to a taxpayer were returned as undeliverable, but they did not check the estate tax records on file in the division's office, which would have indicated that the taxpayer had died and that a personal representative of the decedent's estate had been appointed, along with sufficient information whereby the name and address of the representative were readily ascertainable, the failure of the division to notify the representative invalidated the subsequent tax sale.

7-38-84. Notices; mailing. 
A. Any notice that is required to be made to a property owner by the Property Tax Code is effective if mailed by regular first class mail to the property owner's last address or to the address of any person other than the owner to whom the tax bill is to be sent as shown by the valuation records unless the provisions of that code require a different method of notification or mailing, in which case the notice is effective if given in accordance with the provisions of that code.  
B. If a property owner notifies, in writing or by electronic mail, the county assessor or the county treasurer that the property owner wants to receive notices pursuant to the Property Tax Code by electronic mail rather than by regular first class mail, the county assessor or the county treasurer may thereafter provide such notices to the property owner using an electronic mail address provided by the property owner; provided that the notice is consistent with the requirements of the Electronic Authentication of Documents Act [14-15-1 to 14-15-6 NMSA 1978] and the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act [Chapter 14, Article 16 NMSA 1978]. A property owner's request to receive notices by electronic mail shall be effective until revoked in writing or by electronic mail to the county assessor and the county treasurer. Wherever the Property Tax Code requires a method of notification or mailing done only by the county assessor or county treasurer, other than by regular first class mail, the notice is effective if given in accordance with the provisions of that code.  
C. An electronic mail address provided by a property owner pursuant to this section shall not be considered a valuation record pursuant to Section 7-38-19 NMSA 1978 and shall be retained by the county assessor as a confidential record that is not subject to inspection pursuant to the Inspection of Public Records Act [Chapter 14, Article 2 NMSA 1978].

For a surplus lines policy issued to an insured whose home state is New Mexico and where only a portion of the risk is located in New Mexico, the entire premium tax shall be paid in accordance with this section. 
E. In addition to the premium tax, except as provided in Subsection F of this section, a health insurance premium surtax is imposed at a rate of three and seventy-five hundredths percent of the gross health insurance premiums and membership and policy fees received by the taxpayer on hospital and medical expense incurred insurance or contracts; nonprofit health care plan contracts, excluding dental or vision only contracts; and health maintenance organization subscriber contracts covering health risks within this state during the preceding calendar year.  The surtax shall not apply to return health insurance premiums, dividends paid or credited to policyholders or contract holders and health insurance premiums received for reinsurance on New Mexico risks.  The surtax imposed pursuant to this subsection may be referred to as the "health insurance premium surtax". 
F. If an act of the United States congress is signed into law that imposes the annual fee on health insurance providers pursuant to Section 9010 of the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or that imposes a substantially similar fee on the 
same class of taxpayers, the rate of the health insurance premium surtax shall be decreased at a rate equal to the rate of the annual fee imposed; provided that the rate of the health insurance premium surtax shall not be less than one percent.  A reduction in the health insurance premium surtax pursuant to this subsection shall go into effect on the later of the effective date of the imposition of the federal annual fee or ninety days after the congressional act imposing the federal annual fee is signed into law. 
G. A tax is imposed at a rate of nine-tenths percent on the net premiums, as defined in the Group Self-Insurance Act, received or written by a self-insured group within the state during the preceding calendar year.  The tax imposed pursuant to this subsection may be referred to as the "self-insured group tax".

E. No later than thirty days following the effective date of the Health Care Quality Surcharge Act, a health care facility shall report to the human services department [health care authority department] the number of resident days provided by the health care facility, broken down by payer, and the net revenue earned by the health care facility for each of the most recent four calendar quarters available.
