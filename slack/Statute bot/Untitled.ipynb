It also mentions the different amendments made to this section over the years and how they relate to small winers, winegrowers, and craft distillers both in-state and out-of-state.\n",

      "Amendment 2000 and 2008 both made changes to the excise tax rates for alcohol production in New Mexico. However, they made different changes to different types of alcohol.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amendment 2000, effective July 1, 2000, substituted \"five hundred sixty thousand liters\" for \"three hundred seventy-five thousand liters\" in Subsection E. This change increased the minimum production of wine required for a producer to be subject to the excise tax.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, Amendment 2008, effective July 1, 2008, increased the minimum production of wine even further, from five hundred sixty thousand liters to nine hundred fifty thousand liters. This change also added Subsections B and C, which specified different tax rates for different levels of wine production.\n",

      "Additionally, Amendment 2000 changed the excise tax on beer produced by a microbrewer from twenty-five cents per gallon to eight cents per gallon. However, Amendment 2008 did not make any changes to the tax rate for beer.\n",
